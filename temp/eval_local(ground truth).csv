in a new business model such as the retail segment is inherently risky , particularly in light of the significant investment involved , the current economic climate , and the fixed nature of a substantial portion of the retail segment's operating expenses . results for this segment are dependent upon a number of risks and uncertainties , some of which are discussed below under the heading ""factors that may affect future results and financial condition."" backlog in the company's experience , the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects . in particular , backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of over- ordering by dealers anticipating shortages . backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply . because of the foregoing , backlog cannot be considered a reliable indicator of the company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance . further information regarding the company's backlog may be found below under the heading ""factors that may affect future results and financial condition."" gross margin gross margin for the three fiscal years ended september 28 , 2002 are as follows ( in millions , except gross margin percentages ) : gross margin increased to 28% ( 28 % ) of net sales in 2002 from 23% ( 23 % ) in 2001 . as discussed below , gross margin in 2001 was unusually low resulting from negative gross margin of 2% ( 2 % ) experienced in the first quarter of 2001 . as a percentage of net sales , the company's quarterly gross margins declined during fiscal 2002 from 31% ( 31 % ) in the first quarter down to 26% ( 26 % ) in the fourth quarter . this decline resulted from several factors including a rise in component costs as the year progressed and aggressive pricing by the company across its products lines instituted as a result of continued pricing pressures in the personal computer industry . the company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2003 in light of weak economic conditions , flat demand for personal computers in general , and the resulting pressure on prices . the foregoing statements regarding anticipated gross margin in 2003 and the general demand for personal computers during 2003 are forward- looking . gross margin could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors , including certain of those set forth below in the subsection entitled ""factors that may affect future results and financial condition."" there can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained , targeted gross margin levels will be achieved , or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained . in general , gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors , including continued industry wide global pricing pressures , increased competition , compressed product life cycles , potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services , and potential changes to the company's product mix , including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins . in response to these downward pressures , the company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products . gross margins could also be affected by the company's ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products . the company's operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time ; however , the company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates . the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments . because the company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes , there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components . the company's operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company's ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns . gross margin declined to 23% ( 23 % ) of net sales in 2001 from 27% ( 27 % ) in 2000 . this decline resulted primarily from gross margin of negative 2% ( 2 % ) experienced during the first quarter of 2001 compared to 26% ( 26 % ) gross margin for the same quarter in 2000 . in addition to lower than normal net . .

26 | 2009 annual report in fiscal 2008 , revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased 14% ( 14 % ) from fiscal 2007 . all revenue components within the segment experienced growth during fiscal 2008 . license revenue generated the largest dollar growth in revenue as episys ae , our flagship core processing system aimed at larger credit unions , experienced strong sales throughout the year . support and service revenue , which is the largest component of total revenues for the credit union segment , experienced 34 percent growth in eft support and 10 percent growth in in-house support . gross profit in this business segment increased $ 9344 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 , due primarily to the increase in license revenue , which carries the highest margins . liquidity and capital resources we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements . we expect this trend to continue in the future . the company 2019s cash and cash equivalents increased to $ 118251 at june 30 , 2009 from $ 65565 at june 30 , 2008 . the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows : 2009 2008 2007 . year ended june 30 , cash provided by operations increased $ 25587 to $ 206588 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2009 as compared to $ 181001 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2008 . this increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in receivables compared to the same period a year ago of $ 21214 . this decrease is largely the result of fiscal 2010 annual software maintenance billings being provided to customers earlier than in the prior year , which allowed more cash to be collected before the end of the fiscal year than in previous years . further , we collected more cash overall related to revenues that will be recognized in subsequent periods in the current year than in fiscal 2008 . cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2009 was $ 59227 and includes $ 3027 in contingent consideration paid on prior years 2019 acquisitions . cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2008 was $ 102148 and includes payments for acquisitions of $ 48109 , plus $ 1215 in contingent consideration paid on prior years 2019 acquisitions . capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 were $ 31562 compared to $ 31105 for fiscal 2008 . cash used for software development in fiscal 2009 was $ 24684 compared to $ 23736 during the prior year . net cash used in financing activities for the current fiscal year was $ 94675 and includes the repurchase of 3106 shares of our common stock for $ 58405 , the payment of dividends of $ 26903 and $ 13489 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities . cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 3773 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock ( through the employee stock purchase plan ) and $ 348 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . during fiscal 2008 , net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year was $ 101905 and includes the repurchase of 4200 shares of our common stock for $ 100996 , the payment of dividends of $ 24683 and $ 429 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities . cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 20394 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock and $ 3809 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . beginning during fiscal 2008 , us financial markets and many of the largest us financial institutions have been shaken by negative developments in the home mortgage industry and the mortgage markets , and particularly the markets for subprime mortgage-backed securities . since that time , these and other such developments have resulted in a broad , global economic downturn . while we , as is the case with most companies , have experienced the effects of this downturn , we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts , and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity will be minimized by cash generated by recurring sources of revenue and due to our access to available lines of credit. .

the following table identifies the company 2019s aggregate contractual obligations due by payment period : payments due by period . [1] the following points are significant to understanding the cash flows estimated for obligations under property and casualty contracts : reserves for property & casualty unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses include case reserves for reported claims and reserves for claims incurred but not reported ( ibnr ) . while payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the company , the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and ibnr is an estimate , subject to significant uncertainty . the actual amount to be paid is not determined until the company reaches a settlement with the claimant . final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates , particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future . in estimating the timing of future payments by year , the company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue . however , the actual timing of future payments will likely vary materially from these estimates due to , among other things , changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements . in particular , there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental claims . also , estimated payments in 2005 do not include payments that will be made on claims incurred in 2005 on policies that were in force as of december 31 , 2004 . in addition , the table does not include future cash flows related to the receipt of premiums that will be used , in part , to fund loss payments . under generally accepted accounting principles , the company is only permitted to discount reserves for claim and claim adjustment expenses in cases where the payment pattern and ultimate loss costs are fixed and reliably determinable on an individual claim basis . for the company , these include claim settlements with permanently disabled claimants and certain structured settlement contracts that fund loss runoffs for unrelated parties . as of december 31 , 2004 , the total property and casualty reserves in the above table of $ 21885 are gross of the reserve discount of $ 556 . [2] estimated life , annuity and disability obligations include death and disability claims , policy surrenders , policyholder dividends and trail commissions offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force contracts . estimated contractual policyholder obligations are based on mortality , morbidity and lapse assumptions comparable with life 2019s historical experience , modified for recent observed trends . life has also assumed market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs . in contrast to this table , the majority of life 2019s obligations are recorded on the balance sheet at the current account value , as described in critical accounting estimates , and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth , interest crediting , or future deposits . therefore , the estimated contractual policyholder obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses , other policyholder funds and benefits payable and separate account liabilities . due to the significance of the assumptions used , the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results . as separate account obligations are legally insulated from general account obligations , the separate account obligations will be fully funded by cash flows from separate account assets . life expects to fully fund the general account obligations from cash flows from general account investments and future deposits and premiums . [3] includes contractual principal and interest payments . payments exclude amounts associated with fair-value hedges of certain of the company 2019s long-term debt . all long-term debt obligations have fixed rates of interest . long-term debt obligations also includes principal and interest payments of $ 700 and $ 2.4 billion , respectively , related to junior subordinated debentures which are callable beginning in 2006 . see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of long-term debt obligations . [4] includes $ 1.4 billion in commitments to purchase investments including $ 330 of limited partnerships and $ 299 of mortgage loans . outstanding commitments under these limited partnerships and mortgage loans are included in payments due in less than 1 year since the timing of funding these commitments cannot be estimated . the remaining $ 759 relates to payables for securities purchased which are reflected on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet . [5] includes estimated contribution of $ 200 to the company 2019s pension plan in 2005 . [6] as of december 31 , 2004 , the company has accepted cash collateral of $ 1.6 billion in connection with the company 2019s securities lending program and derivative instruments . since the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain , the return of the collateral has been included in the payments due in less than 1 year . [7] includes $ 52 in collateralized loan obligations ( 201cclos 201d ) issued to third-party investors by a consolidated investment management entity sponsored by the company in connection with synthetic clo transactions . the clo investors have no recourse to the company 2019s assets other than the dedicated assets collateralizing the clos . refer to note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of .

long-term product offerings include alpha-seeking active and index strategies . our alpha-seeking active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile , and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction . in contrast , index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index , generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index . index strategies include both our non-etf index products and ishares etfs . although many clients use both alpha-seeking active and index strategies , the application of these strategies may differ . for example , clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class , or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns . in addition , institutional non-etf index assignments tend to be very large ( multi-billion dollars ) and typically reflect low fee rates . net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on blackrock 2019s revenues and earnings . equity year-end 2017 equity aum totaled $ 3.372 trillion , reflecting net inflows of $ 130.1 billion . net inflows included $ 174.4 billion into ishares etfs , driven by net inflows into core funds and broad developed and emerging market equities , partially offset by non-etf index and active net outflows of $ 25.7 billion and $ 18.5 billion , respectively . blackrock 2019s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aum mix . approximately half of blackrock 2019s equity aum is tied to international markets , including emerging markets , which tend to have higher fee rates than u.s . equity strategies . accordingly , fluctuations in international equity markets , which may not consistently move in tandem with u.s . markets , have a greater impact on blackrock 2019s equity revenues and effective fee rate . fixed income fixed income aum ended 2017 at $ 1.855 trillion , reflecting net inflows of $ 178.8 billion . in 2017 , active net inflows of $ 21.5 billion were diversified across fixed income offerings , and included strong inflows into municipal , unconstrained and total return bond funds . ishares etfs net inflows of $ 67.5 billion were led by flows into core , corporate and treasury bond funds . non-etf index net inflows of $ 89.8 billion were driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions . multi-asset blackrock 2019s multi-asset team manages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities , bonds , currencies and commodities , and our extensive risk management capabilities . investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays . component changes in multi-asset aum for 2017 are presented below .

( b ) other changes in expected cash flows include the net impact of changes in esti- mated prepayments and reclassifications to the nonaccretable difference . on a quarterly basis , the firm updates the amount of loan principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected , incorporating assumptions regarding default rates , loss severities , the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions . probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows trigger the recognition of impairment , which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus any related foregone interest cash flows discounted at the pool 2019s effective interest rate . impairments that occur after the acquisition date are recognized through the provision and allow- ance for loan losses . probable and significant increases in expected principal cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses ; any remaining increases are recognized prospectively as interest income . the impacts of ( i ) prepayments , ( ii ) changes in variable interest rates , and ( iii ) any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income . disposals of loans , which may include sales of loans , receipt of payments in full by the borrower , or foreclosure , result in removal of the loan from the purchased credit-impaired portfolio . if the timing and/or amounts of expected cash flows on these purchased credit-impaired loans were determined not to be rea- sonably estimable , no interest would be accreted and the loans would be reported as nonperforming loans ; however , since the timing and amounts of expected cash flows for these purchased credit-impaired loans are reasonably estimable , interest is being accreted and the loans are being reported as performing loans . charge-offs are not recorded on purchased credit-impaired loans until actual losses exceed the estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at acquisition date . to date , no charge-offs have been recorded for these loans . purchased credit-impaired loans acquired in the washington mu- tual transaction are reported in loans on the firm 2019s consolidated balance sheets . in 2009 , an allowance for loan losses of $ 1.6 billion was recorded for the prime mortgage and option arm pools of loans . the net aggregate carrying amount of the pools that have an allowance for loan losses was $ 47.2 billion at december 31 , 2009 . this allowance for loan losses is reported as a reduction of the carrying amount of the loans in the table below . the table below provides additional information about these pur- chased credit-impaired consumer loans. . ( a ) represents the sum of contractual principal , interest and fees earned at the reporting date . purchased credit-impaired loans are also being modified under the mha programs and the firm 2019s other loss mitigation programs . for these loans , the impact of the modification is incorporated into the firm 2019s quarterly assessment of whether a probable and/or signifi- cant change in estimated future cash flows has occurred , and the loans continue to be accounted for as and reported as purchased credit-impaired loans . foreclosed property the firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructur- ings , workouts , and foreclosures , which is recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets . property acquired may include real property ( e.g. , land , buildings , and fixtures ) and commercial and personal property ( e.g. , aircraft , railcars , and ships ) . acquired property is valued at fair value less costs to sell at acquisition . each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted , if necessary . any adjustments to fair value in the first 90 days are charged to the allowance for loan losses and thereafter adjustments are charged/credited to noninterest revenue 2013other . operating expense , such as real estate taxes and maintenance , are charged to other expense . note 14 2013 allowance for credit losses the allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component , a formula-based component and a component related to purchased credit-impaired loans . the asset-specific component relates to loans considered to be impaired , which includes any loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring as well as risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status . an asset-specific allowance for impaired loans is established when the loan 2019s discounted cash flows ( or , when available , the loan 2019s observable market price ) is lower than the recorded investment in the loan . to compute the asset-specific component of the allowance , larger loans are evaluated individually , while smaller loans are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets . risk-rated loans ( primarily wholesale loans ) are pooled by risk rating , while scored loans ( i.e. , consumer loans ) are pooled by product type . the firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected , dis- counted at the loan 2019s original effective interest rate . subsequent changes in measured impairment due to the impact of discounting are reported as an adjustment to the provision for loan losses , not as an adjustment to interest income . an asset-specific allowance for an impaired loan with an observable market price is measured as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the loan 2019s fair value . certain impaired loans that are determined to be collateral- dependent are charged-off to the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell . when collateral-dependent commercial real-estate loans are determined to be impaired , updated appraisals are typi- cally obtained and updated every six to twelve months . the firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors , which .

gain or loss on ownership change in map results from contributions to map of certain environmental capital expenditures and leased property acquisitions funded by marathon and ashland . in accordance with map 2019s limited liability company agreement , in certain instances , environmental capital expenditures and acquisitions of leased properties are funded by the original contributor of the assets , but no change in ownership interest may result from these contributions . an excess of ashland funded improvements over marathon funded improvements results in a net gain and an excess of marathon funded improvements over ashland funded improvements results in a net loss . cost of revenues increased by $ 5.822 billion in 2004 from 2003 and by $ 6.040 billion in 2003 from 2002 . the increases are primarily in the rm&t segment and result from higher acquisition costs for crude oil , refined products , refinery charge and blend feedstocks and increased manufacturing expenses . selling , general and administrative expenses increased by $ 105 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $ 97 million in 2003 from 2002 . the increase in 2004 was primarily due to increased stock-based compensation and higher costs associated with business transformation and outsourcing . our 2004 results were also impacted by start-up costs associated with the lng project in equatorial guinea and the increased cost of complying with governmental regulations . the increase in 2003 was primarily due to increased employee benefit expenses ( caused by increased pension expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions and a decrease in realized returns on plan assets ) and other employee related costs . additionally , during 2003 , we recorded a charge of $ 24 million related to organizational and business process changes . inventory market valuation reserve ( 2018 2018imv 2019 2019 ) is established to reduce the cost basis of inventories to current market value . generally , we will establish an imv reserve when crude oil prices fall below $ 22 per barrel . the 2002 results of operations include credits to income from operations of $ 71 million , reversing the imv reserve at december 31 , 2001 . net interest and other financial costs decreased by $ 25 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $ 82 million in 2003 from 2002 . the decrease in 2004 is primarily due to an increase in interest income . the decrease in 2003 is primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest related to increased long-term construction projects , the favorable effect of interest rate swaps , the favorable effect of a reduction in interest on tax deficiencies and increased interest income on investments . additionally , included in net interest and other financing costs are foreign currency gains of $ 9 million , $ 13 million and $ 8 million for 2004 , 2003 and 2002 . loss from early extinguishment of debt in 2002 was attributable to the retirement of $ 337 million aggregate principal amount of debt , resulting in a loss of $ 53 million . minority interest in income of map , which represents ashland 2019s 38 percent ownership interest , increased by $ 230 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $ 129 million in 2003 from 2002 . map income was higher in 2004 compared to 2003 and in 2003 compared to 2002 as discussed below in the rm&t segment . minority interest in loss of equatorial guinea lng holdings limited , which represents gepetrol 2019s 25 percent ownership interest , was $ 7 million in 2004 , primarily resulting from gepetrol 2019s share of start-up costs associated with the lng project in equatorial guinea . provision for income taxes increased by $ 143 million in 2004 from 2003 and by $ 215 million in 2003 from 2002 , primarily due to $ 388 million and $ 720 million increases in income before income taxes . the effective tax rate for 2004 was 36.6 percent compared to 36.6 percent and 42.1 percent for 2003 and 2002 . the higher rate in 2002 was due to the united kingdom enactment of a supplementary 10 percent tax on profits from the north sea oil and gas production , retroactively effective to april 17 , 2002 . in 2002 , we recognized a one-time noncash deferred tax adjustment of $ 61 million as a result of the rate increase . the following is an analysis of the effective tax rate for the periods presented: .

item 7 . management 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary international paper 2019s operating results in 2007 bene- fited from significantly higher paper and packaging price realizations . sales volumes were slightly high- er , with growth in overseas markets partially offset by lower volumes in north america as we continued to balance our production with our customers 2019 demand . operationally , our pulp and paper and containerboard mills ran very well in 2007 . however , input costs for wood , energy and transportation costs were all well above 2006 levels . in our forest products business , earnings decreased 31% ( 31 % ) reflect- ing a sharp decline in harvest income and a smaller drop in forestland and real estate sales , both reflect- ing our forestland divestitures in 2006 . interest expense decreased over 40% ( 40 % ) , principally due to lower debt balances and interest rates from debt repayments and refinancings . looking forward to the first quarter of 2008 , we expect demand for north american printing papers and packaging to remain steady . however , if the economic downturn in 2008 is greater than expected , this could have a negative impact on sales volumes and earnings . some slight increases in paper and packaging price realizations are expected as we implement our announced price increases . however , first quarter earnings will reflect increased planned maintenance expenses and continued escalation of wood , energy and transportation costs . as a result , excluding the impact of projected reduced earnings from land sales and the addition of equity earnings contributions from our recent investment in ilim holding s.a . in russia , we expect 2008 first-quarter earnings to be lower than in the 2007 fourth quarter . results of operations industry segment operating profits are used by inter- national paper 2019s management to measure the earn- ings performance of its businesses . management believes that this measure allows a better under- standing of trends in costs , operating efficiencies , prices and volumes . industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes and minority interest , interest expense , corporate items and corporate special items . industry segment oper- ating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a non-gaap financial measure , and are not gaap alternatives to net earn- ings or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states . international paper operates in six segments : print- ing papers , industrial packaging , consumer pack- aging , distribution , forest products , and specialty businesses and other . the following table shows the components of net earnings for each of the last three years : in millions 2007 2006 2005 . * corporate special items include restructuring and other charg- es , net ( gains ) losses on sales and impairments of businesses , gains on transformation plan forestland sales , goodwill impairment charges , insurance recoveries and reversals of reserves no longer required . industry segment operating profits of $ 2.4 billion were $ 349 million higher in 2007 than in 2006 due principally to the benefits from higher average price realizations ( $ 461 million ) , the net impact of cost reduction initiatives , improved operating perform- ance and a more favorable mix of products sold ( $ 304 million ) , higher sales volumes ( $ 17 million ) , lower special item costs ( $ 115 million ) and other items ( $ 4 million ) . these benefits more than offset the impacts of higher energy , raw material and freight costs ( $ 205 million ) , higher costs for planned mill maintenance outages ( $ 48 million ) , lower earn- ings from land sales ( $ 101 million ) , costs at the pensacola mill associated with the conversion of a machine to the production of linerboard ( $ 52 million ) and reduced earnings due to net acquisitions and divestitures ( $ 146 million ) . segment operating profit ( in millions ) $ 2074 ( $ 205 ) ( $ 48 ) $ 17 ( $ 244 ) $ 2423$ 4 ( $ 52 ) ( $ 101 ) $ 461 $ 1000 $ 1500 $ 2000 $ 2500 $ 3000 .

note 9 . retirement plan we maintain a defined contribution pension plan covering full-time shoreside employees who have completed the minimum period of continuous service . annual contributions to the plan are based on fixed percentages of participants 2019 salaries and years of service , not to exceed certain maximums . pension cost was $ 13.9 million , $ 12.8 million and $ 12.2 million for the years ended december 31 , 2006 , 2005 and 2004 , respectively . note 10 . income taxes we and the majority of our subsidiaries are currently exempt from united states corporate tax on income from the international opera- tion of ships pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code . income tax expense related to our remaining subsidiaries was not significant for the years ended december 31 , 2006 , 2005 and 2004 . final regulations under section 883 were published on august 26 , 2003 , and were effective for the year ended december 31 , 2005 . these regulations confirmed that we qualify for the exemption provid- ed by section 883 , but also narrowed the scope of activities which are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships . the activities listed in the regula- tions as not being incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of air and other transportation such as transfers , shore excursions and pre and post cruise tours . to the extent the income from such activities is earned from sources within the united states , such income will be subject to united states taxa- tion . the application of these new regulations reduced our net income for the years ended december 31 , 2006 and december 31 , 2005 by approximately $ 6.3 million and $ 14.0 million , respectively . note 11 . financial instruments the estimated fair values of our financial instruments are as follows ( in thousands ) : . long-term debt ( including current portion of long-term debt ) ( 5474988 ) ( 4368874 ) foreign currency forward contracts in a net ( loss ) gain position 104159 ( 115415 ) interest rate swap agreements in a net receivable position 5856 8456 fuel swap agreements in a net payable position ( 20456 ) ( 78 ) the reported fair values are based on a variety of factors and assumptions . accordingly , the fair values may not represent actual values of the financial instruments that could have been realized as of december 31 , 2006 or 2005 , or that will be realized in the future and do not include expenses that could be incurred in an actual sale or settlement . our financial instruments are not held for trading or speculative purposes . our exposure under foreign currency contracts , interest rate and fuel swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to the contracts , all of which are currently our lending banks . to minimize this risk , we select counterparties with credit risks acceptable to us and we limit our exposure to an individual counterparty . furthermore , all foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in primary currencies . cash and cash equivalents the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to the short maturity of these instruments . long-term debt the fair values of our senior notes and senior debentures were esti- mated by obtaining quoted market prices . the fair values of all other debt were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on market rates available to us for similar debt with the same remaining maturities . foreign currency contracts the fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were esti- mated using current market prices for similar instruments . our expo- sure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to six ship construction contracts and forecasted transactions . we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates . as of december 31 , 2006 , we had foreign currency forward contracts in a notional amount of $ 3.8 billion maturing through 2009 . as of december 31 , 2006 , the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts related to the six ship construction contracts , which are designated as fair value hedges , was a net unrealized gain of approximately $ 106.3 mil- lion . at december 31 , 2005 , the fair value of our foreign currency for- ward contracts related to three ship construction contracts , designated as fair value hedges , was a net unrealized loss of approx- imately $ 103.4 million . the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts related to the other ship construction contract at december 31 , 2005 , which was designated as a cash flow hedge , was an unre- alized loss , of approximately $ 7.8 million . at december 31 , 2006 , approximately 11% ( 11 % ) of the aggregate cost of the ships was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate . r o y a l c a r i b b e a n c r u i s e s l t d . 3 5 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page

american printing papers net sales in 2009 were $ 2.8 billion compared with $ 3.4 billion in 2008 and $ 3.5 billion in 2007 . operating earnings in 2009 were $ 746 million ( $ 307 million excluding alter- native fuel mixture credits and plant closure costs ) compared with $ 405 million ( $ 435 million excluding shutdown costs for a paper machine ) in 2008 and $ 415 million in 2007 . sales volumes decreased sig- nificantly in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting weak customer demand and reduced production capacity resulting from the shutdown of a paper machine at the franklin mill in december 2008 and the conversion of the bastrop mill to pulp production in june 2008 . average sales price realizations were lower reflecting slight declines for uncoated freesheet paper in domestic markets and significant declines in export markets . margins were also unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of shipments to lower-margin export markets . input costs , however , were favorable due to lower wood and chemical costs and sig- nificantly lower energy costs . freight costs were also lower . planned maintenance downtime costs in 2009 were comparable with 2008 . operating costs were favorable , reflecting cost control efforts and strong machine performance . lack-of-order downtime increased to 525000 tons in 2009 , including 120000 tons related to the shutdown of a paper machine at our franklin mill in the 2008 fourth quarter , from 135000 tons in 2008 . operating earnings in 2009 included $ 671 million of alternative fuel mixture cred- its , $ 223 million of costs associated with the shutdown of our franklin mill and $ 9 million of other shutdown costs , while operating earnings in 2008 included $ 30 million of costs for the shutdown of a paper machine at our franklin mill . looking ahead to 2010 , first-quarter sales volumes are expected to increase slightly from fourth-quarter 2009 levels . average sales price realizations should be higher , reflecting the full-quarter impact of sales price increases announced in the fourth quarter for converting and envelope grades of uncoated free- sheet paper and an increase in prices to export markets . however , input costs for wood , energy and chemicals are expected to continue to increase . planned maintenance downtime costs should be lower and operating costs should be favorable . brazil ian papers net sales for 2009 of $ 960 mil- lion increased from $ 950 million in 2008 and $ 850 million in 2007 . operating profits for 2009 were $ 112 million compared with $ 186 million in 2008 and $ 174 million in 2007 . sales volumes increased in 2009 compared with 2008 for both paper and pulp reflect- ing higher export shipments . average sales price realizations were lower due to strong competitive pressures in the brazilian domestic market in the second half of the year , lower export prices and unfavorable foreign exchange rates . margins were unfavorably affected by a higher proportion of lower margin export sales . input costs for wood and chem- icals were favorable , but these benefits were partially offset by higher energy costs . planned maintenance downtime costs were lower , and operating costs were also favorable . earnings in 2009 were adversely impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange effects . entering 2010 , sales volumes are expected to be seasonally lower compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 . profit margins are expected to be slightly higher reflecting a more favorable geographic sales mix and improving sales price realizations in export markets , partially offset by higher planned main- tenance outage costs . european papers net sales in 2009 were $ 1.3 bil- lion compared with $ 1.7 billion in 2008 and $ 1.5 bil- lion in 2007 . operating profits in 2009 of $ 92 million ( $ 115 million excluding expenses associated with the closure of the inverurie mill ) compared with $ 39 mil- lion ( $ 146 million excluding a charge to reduce the carrying value of the fixed assets at the inverurie , scotland mill to their estimated realizable value ) in 2008 and $ 171 million in 2007 . sales volumes in 2009 were lower than in 2008 primarily due to reduced sales of uncoated freesheet paper following the closure of the inverurie mill in 2009 . average sales price realizations decreased significantly in 2009 across most of western europe , but margins increased in poland and russia reflecting the effect of local currency devaluations . input costs were favorable as lower wood costs , particularly in russia , were only partially offset by higher energy costs in poland and higher chemical costs . planned main- tenance downtime costs were higher in 2009 than in 2008 , while manufacturing operating costs were lower . operating profits in 2009 also reflect favorable foreign exchange impacts . looking ahead to 2010 , sales volumes are expected to decline from strong 2009 fourth-quarter levels despite solid customer demand . average sales price realizations are expected to increase over the quar- ter , primarily in eastern europe , as price increases .

table of contents research and development expense ( 201cr&d 201d ) r&d expense increased 34% ( 34 % ) or $ 449 million to $ 1.8 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 . this increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount and related expenses in the current year to support expanded r&d activities . also contributing to this increase in r&d expense in 2010 was the capitalization in 2009 of software development costs of $ 71 million related to mac os x snow leopard . although total r&d expense increased 34% ( 34 % ) during 2010 , it declined as a percentage of net sales given the 52% ( 52 % ) year-over-year increase in net sales in 2010 . the company continues to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the company 2019s core business strategy . as such , the company expects to make further investments in r&d to remain competitive . r&d expense increased 20% ( 20 % ) or $ 224 million to $ 1.3 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 . this increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount in 2009 to support expanded r&d activities and higher stock-based compensation expenses . additionally , $ 71 million of software development costs were capitalized related to mac os x snow leopard and excluded from r&d expense during 2009 , compared to $ 11 million of software development costs capitalized during 2008 . although total r&d expense increased 20% ( 20 % ) during 2009 , it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 14% ( 14 % ) increase in revenue in 2009 . selling , general and administrative expense ( 201csg&a 201d ) sg&a expense increased $ 1.4 billion or 33% ( 33 % ) to $ 5.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 . this increase was due primarily to the company 2019s continued expansion of its retail segment , higher spending on marketing and advertising programs , increased stock-based compensation expenses and variable costs associated with the overall growth of the company 2019s net sales . sg&a expenses increased $ 388 million or 10% ( 10 % ) to $ 4.1 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 . this increase was due primarily to the company 2019s continued expansion of its retail segment in both domestic and international markets , higher stock-based compensation expense and higher spending on marketing and advertising . other income and expense other income and expense for the three years ended september 25 , 2010 , are as follows ( in millions ) : total other income and expense decreased $ 171 million or 52% ( 52 % ) to $ 155 million during 2010 compared to $ 326 million and $ 620 million in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . the overall decrease in other income and expense is attributable to the significant declines in interest rates on a year- over-year basis , partially offset by the company 2019s higher cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities balances . the weighted average interest rate earned by the company on its cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities was 0.75% ( 0.75 % ) , 1.43% ( 1.43 % ) and 3.44% ( 3.44 % ) during 2010 , 2009 and 2008 , respectively . additionally the company incurred higher premium expenses on its foreign exchange option contracts , which further reduced the total other income and expense . during 2010 , 2009 and 2008 , the company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense . provision for income taxes the company 2019s effective tax rates were 24% ( 24 % ) , 32% ( 32 % ) and 32% ( 32 % ) for 2010 , 2009 and 2008 , respectively . the company 2019s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% ( 35 % ) due . .

however , when the related taxes are paid they are required to be shown as part of cash provided by operating activities . thus , operating cash flows for 2007 were penalized due to cash income tax payments of approximately $ 630 million in 2007 that related to the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business . non-pharmaceutical related cash income tax payments were approximately $ 475 million lower than 2006 due to normal timing differences in tax payments , which benefited cash flows . accounts receivable and inventory increases reduced cash flows in 2007 , but decreased cash flow less than in 2006 , resulting in a year-on-year benefit to cash flows of $ 323 million . the category 201cother-net 201d in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts , including the impact of cash payments made in connection with 3m 2019s restructuring actions ( note 4 ) . in 2006 , cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $ 365 million . this decrease was due in large part to an increase of approximately $ 600 million in tax payments in 2006 compared with 2005 . the higher tax payments in 2006 primarily related to the company 2019s repatriation of $ 1.7 billion of foreign earnings in the united states pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 . the category 201cother-net 201d in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts , including outstanding liabilities at december 31 , 2006 , related to 3m 2019s restructuring actions ( note 4 ) . cash flows from investing activities : years ended december 31 . investments in property , plant and equipment enable growth in diverse markets , helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency . in 2007 , numerous plants were opened or expanded internationally . this included two facilities in korea ( respirator manufacturing facility and optical plant ) , an optical plant in poland , industrial adhesives/tapes facilities in both brazil and the philippines , a plant in russia ( corrosion protection , industrial adhesive and tapes , and respirators ) , a plant in china ( optical systems , industrial adhesives and tapes , and personal care ) , an expansion in canada ( construction and home improvement business ) , in addition to investments in india , mexico and other countries . in addition , 3m expanded manufacturing capabilities in the u.s. , including investments in industrial adhesives/tapes and optical . 3m also exited several high-cost underutilized manufacturing facilities and streamlined several supply chains by relocating equipment from one facility to another . the streamlining work has primarily occurred inside the u.s . and is in addition to the streamlining achieved through plant construction . as a result of this increased activity , capital expenditures were $ 1.422 billion in 2007 , an increase of $ 254 million when compared to 2006 . the company expects capital expenditures to total approximately $ 1.3 billion to $ 1.4 billion in 2008 . refer to the preceding 201ccapital spending/net property , plant and equipment 201d section for more detail . refer to note 2 for information on 2007 , 2006 and 2005 acquisitions . note 2 also provides information on the proceeds from the sale of businesses . the company is actively considering additional acquisitions , investments and strategic alliances , and from time to time may also divest certain businesses . purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from sale ( or maturities ) of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities , agency securities , corporate medium-term note securities , auction rate securities and other securities , which are classified as available-for-sale . refer to note 9 for more details about 3m 2019s diversified marketable securities portfolio , which totaled $ 1.059 billion as of december 31 , 2007 . purchases of marketable securities , net of sales and maturities , totaled $ 429 million for 2007 and $ 637 million for 2006 . purchases of investments in 2005 include the purchase of 19% ( 19 % ) of ti&m beteiligungsgesellschaft mbh for .

other taxes decreased in 2001 because its utility operations in virginia became subject to state income taxes in lieu of gross receipts taxes effective january 2001 . in addition , dominion recognized higher effective rates for foreign earnings and higher pretax income in relation to non-conventional fuel tax credits realized . dominion energy 2002 2001 2000 ( millions , except per share amounts ) . * amounts presented are for electricity supplied by utility and merchant generation operations . operating results 2014 2002 dominion energy contributed $ 2.72 per diluted share on net income of $ 770 million for 2002 , a net income increase of $ 47 million and an earnings per share decrease of $ 0.14 over 2001 . net income for 2002 reflected lower operating revenue ( $ 204 million ) , operating expenses ( $ 229 million ) and other income ( $ 27 million ) . interest expense and income taxes , which are discussed on a consolidated basis , decreased $ 50 million over 2001 . the earnings per share decrease reflected share dilution . regulated electric sales revenue increased $ 179 million . favorable weather conditions , reflecting increased cooling and heating degree-days , as well as customer growth , are estimated to have contributed $ 133 million and $ 41 million , respectively . fuel rate recoveries increased approximately $ 65 million for 2002 . these recoveries are generally offset by increases in elec- tric fuel expense and do not materially affect income . partially offsetting these increases was a net decrease of $ 60 million due to other factors not separately measurable , such as the impact of economic conditions on customer usage , as well as variations in seasonal rate premiums and discounts . nonregulated electric sales revenue increased $ 9 million . sales revenue from dominion 2019s merchant generation fleet decreased $ 21 million , reflecting a $ 201 million decline due to lower prices partially offset by sales from assets acquired and constructed in 2002 and the inclusion of millstone operations for all of 2002 . revenue from the wholesale marketing of utility generation decreased $ 74 million . due to the higher demand of utility service territory customers during 2002 , less production from utility plant generation was available for profitable sale in the wholesale market . revenue from retail energy sales increased $ 71 million , reflecting primarily customer growth over the prior year . net revenue from dominion 2019s electric trading activities increased $ 33 million , reflecting the effect of favorable price changes on unsettled contracts and higher trading margins . nonregulated gas sales revenue decreased $ 351 million . the decrease included a $ 239 million decrease in sales by dominion 2019s field services and retail energy marketing opera- tions , reflecting to a large extent declining prices . revenue associated with gas trading operations , net of related cost of sales , decreased $ 112 million . the decrease included $ 70 mil- lion of realized and unrealized losses on the economic hedges of natural gas production by the dominion exploration & pro- duction segment . as described below under selected information 2014 energy trading activities , sales of natural gas by the dominion exploration & production segment at market prices offset these financial losses , resulting in a range of prices contemplated by dominion 2019s overall risk management strategy . the remaining $ 42 million decrease was due to unfavorable price changes on unsettled contracts and lower overall trading margins . those losses were partially offset by contributions from higher trading volumes in gas and oil markets . gas transportation and storage revenue decreased $ 44 million , primarily reflecting lower rates . electric fuel and energy purchases expense increased $ 94 million which included an increase of $ 66 million associated with dominion 2019s energy marketing operations that are not sub- ject to cost-based rate regulation and an increase of $ 28 million associated with utility operations . substantially all of the increase associated with non-regulated energy marketing opera- tions related to higher volumes purchased during the year . for utility operations , energy costs increased $ 66 million for pur- chases subject to rate recovery , partially offset by a $ 38 million decrease in fuel expenses associated with lower wholesale mar- keting of utility plant generation . purchased gas expense decreased $ 245 million associated with dominion 2019s field services and retail energy marketing oper- ations . this decrease reflected approximately $ 162 million asso- ciated with declining prices and $ 83 million associated with lower purchased volumes . liquids , pipeline capacity and other purchases decreased $ 64 million , primarily reflecting comparably lower levels of rate recoveries of certain costs of transmission operations in the cur- rent year period . the difference between actual expenses and amounts recovered in the period are deferred pending future rate adjustments . other operations and maintenance expense decreased $ 14 million , primarily reflecting an $ 18 million decrease in outage costs due to fewer generation unit outages in the current year . depreciation expense decreased $ 11 million , reflecting decreases in depreciation associated with changes in the esti- mated useful lives of certain electric generation property , par- tially offset by increased depreciation associated with state line and millstone operations .

the company endeavors to actively engage with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to mt . mckinley . such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement , negotiation , litigation , or the monitoring of claim activity under settlement in place ( 201csip 201d ) agreements . sip agreements generally condition an insurer 2019s payment upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other measures to control the insurer 2019s payments . the company 2019s mt . mckinley operation is currently managing four sip agreements , one of which was executed prior to the acquisition of mt . mckinley in 2000 . the company 2019s preference with respect to coverage settlements is to execute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments , because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty . the company has significantly enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics over time , as well as its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active . those insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous , but still active management , with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics , which may indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity . the company continually focuses on further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential exposure of policyholders . everest re 2019s book of assumed a&e reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a limited number of contracts and for a limited period , from 1974 to 1984 . because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the company has been managing the a&e exposures for many years , its claim staff is familiar with the ceding companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to generate future liabilities . the company 2019s claim staff has developed familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims handling and reserving practices of those companies . this level of familiarity enhances the quality of the company 2019s analysis of its exposure through those companies . as a result , the company believes that it can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure , such as non-products asbestos claims , for concentrated attention . however , in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities , the company relies on claims data supplied , both formally and informally by its ceding companies and brokers . this furnished information is not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeliness of the company 2019s ultimate loss projections . the following table summarizes the composition of the company 2019s total reserves for a&e losses , gross and net of reinsurance , for the periods indicated: . ( 1 ) additional reserves are case specific reserves established by the company in excess of those reported by the ceding company , based on the company 2019s assessment of the covered loss . ( some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding. ) additional losses , including those relating to latent injuries and other exposures , which are as yet unrecognized , the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by either the company or the industry , may emerge in the future . such future emergence could have material adverse effects on the company 2019s future financial condition , results of operations and cash flows. .

united parcel service , inc . and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources operating activities the following is a summary of the significant sources ( uses ) of cash from operating activities ( amounts in millions ) : . ( a ) represents depreciation and amortization , gains and losses on derivative and foreign exchange transactions , deferred income taxes , provisions for uncollectible accounts , pension and postretirement benefit expense , stock compensation expense , impairment charges and other non-cash items . cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the 2010 to 2012 time period . operating cash flow was favorably impacted in 2012 , compared with 2011 , by lower contributions into our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans ; however , this was partially offset by changes in our working capital position , which was impacted by overall growth in the business . the change in the cash flows for income tax receivables and payables in 2011 and 2010 was primarily related to the timing of discretionary pension contributions during 2010 , as discussed further in the following paragraph . except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans , contributions to our company-sponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans . 2022 in 2012 , we made a $ 355 million required contribution to the ups ibt pension plan . 2022 in 2011 , we made a $ 1.2 billion contribution to the ups ibt pension plan , which satisfied our 2011 contribution requirements and also approximately $ 440 million in contributions that would not have been required until after 2011 . 2022 in 2010 , we made $ 2.0 billion in discretionary contributions to our ups retirement and ups pension plans , and $ 980 million in required contributions to our ups ibt pension plan . 2022 the remaining contributions in the 2010 through 2012 period were largely due to contributions to our international pension plans and u.s . postretirement medical benefit plans . as discussed further in the 201ccontractual commitments 201d section , we have minimum funding requirements in the next several years , primarily related to the ups ibt pension , ups retirement and ups pension plans . as of december 31 , 2012 , the total of our worldwide holdings of cash and cash equivalents was $ 7.327 billion . approximately $ 4.211 billion of this amount was held in european subsidiaries with the intended purpose of completing the acquisition of tnt express n.v . ( see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements ) . excluding this portion of cash held outside the u.s . for acquisition-related purposes , approximately 50%-60% ( 50%-60 % ) of the remaining cash and cash equivalents are held by foreign subsidiaries throughout the year . the amount of cash held by our u.s . and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors , including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business . cash provided by operating activities in the united states continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs , capital expenditures , share repurchases and dividend payments to shareowners . to the extent that such amounts represent previously untaxed earnings , the cash held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to tax if such amounts were repatriated in the form of dividends ; however , not all international cash balances would have to be repatriated in the form of a dividend if returned to the u.s . when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested , no accrual for taxes is provided. .

management 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) detail with respect to our investment portfolio as of december 31 , 2014 and 2013 is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k . loans and leases averaged $ 15.91 billion for the year ended 2014 , up from $ 13.78 billion in 2013 . the increase was mainly related to mutual fund lending and our continued investment in senior secured bank loans . mutual fund lending and senior secured bank loans averaged approximately $ 9.12 billion and $ 1.40 billion , respectively , for the year ended december 31 , 2014 compared to $ 8.16 billion and $ 170 million for the year ended december 31 , 2013 , respectively . average loans and leases also include short- duration advances . table 13 : u.s . and non-u.s . short-duration advances years ended december 31 . average u.s . short-duration advances $ 2355 $ 2356 $ 1972 average non-u.s . short-duration advances 1512 1393 1393 average total short-duration advances $ 3867 $ 3749 $ 3365 average short-durance advances to average loans and leases 24% ( 24 % ) 27% ( 27 % ) 29% ( 29 % ) the decline in proportion of the average daily short-duration advances to average loans and leases is primarily due to growth in the other segments of the loan and lease portfolio . short-duration advances provide liquidity to clients in support of their investment activities . although average short-duration advances for the year ended december 31 , 2014 increased compared to the year ended december 31 , 2013 , such average advances remained low relative to historical levels , mainly the result of clients continuing to hold higher levels of liquidity . average other interest-earning assets increased to $ 15.94 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2014 from $ 11.16 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2013 . the increased levels were primarily the result of higher levels of cash collateral provided in connection with our enhanced custody business . aggregate average interest-bearing deposits increased to $ 130.30 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2014 from $ 109.25 billion for year ended 2013 . the higher levels were primarily the result of increases in both u.s . and non-u.s . transaction accounts and time deposits . future transaction account levels will be influenced by the underlying asset servicing business , as well as market conditions , including the general levels of u.s . and non-u.s . interest rates . average other short-term borrowings increased to $ 4.18 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2014 from $ 3.79 billion for the year ended 2013 . the increase was the result of a higher level of client demand for our commercial paper . the decline in rates paid from 1.6% ( 1.6 % ) in 2013 to 0.1% ( 0.1 % ) in 2014 resulted from a reclassification of certain derivative contracts that hedge our interest-rate risk on certain assets and liabilities , which reduced interest revenue and interest expense . average long-term debt increased to $ 9.31 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2014 from $ 8.42 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2013 . the increase primarily reflected the issuance of $ 1.5 billion of senior and subordinated debt in may 2013 , $ 1.0 billion of senior debt issued in november 2013 , and $ 1.0 billion of senior debt issued in december 2014 . this is partially offset by the maturities of $ 500 million of senior debt in may 2014 and $ 250 million of senior debt in march 2014 . average other interest-bearing liabilities increased to $ 7.35 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2014 from $ 6.46 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2013 , primarily the result of higher levels of cash collateral received from clients in connection with our enhanced custody business . several factors could affect future levels of our net interest revenue and margin , including the mix of client liabilities ; actions of various central banks ; changes in u.s . and non-u.s . interest rates ; changes in the various yield curves around the world ; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards , or interpretations of those standards ; the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment securities portfolio ; and the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured . based on market conditions and other factors , we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated securities , such as u.s . treasury and agency securities , municipal securities , federal agency mortgage-backed securities and u.s . and non-u.s . mortgage- and asset-backed securities . the pace at which we continue to reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions and other factors over time . we expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to influence what effect our reinvestment program will have on future levels of our net interest revenue and net interest margin. .

Step 1: Calculate the percentage change for American Airlines Group Inc. from 12/9/2013 to 12/31/2015. The formula for percentage change is ((new - old)/old) * 100.
- Old value (12/9/2013) = $100
- New value (12/31/2015) = $175
- Percentage change = ((175 - 100)/100) * 100 = 75%

Step 2: Calculate the percentage change for S&P 500 from 12/9/2013 to 12/31/2015.
- Old value (12/9/2013) = 100
- New value (12/31/2015) = 113
- Percentage change = ((113 - 100)/100) * 100 = 13%

Step 3: Subtract the percentage change of S&P 500 from the percentage change of American Airlines Group Inc. to find out by how much American Airlines Group Inc. outperformed the S&P 500.

Step 1: From the table, the target operating cash flow for 2011 was $3.35 billion.
Step 2: The table also mentions that the company fell short of the operating cash flow goal by $221 million in 2011.
Step 3: Therefore, the actual operating cash flow for 2011 can be calculated by subtracting the shortfall from the target. 
Step 4: Actual Operating Cash Flow 2011 = Target Operating Cash Flow 2011 - Shortfall = $3.35 billion - $0.221 billion = $3.129 billion.

aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2011 increased $ 132 million , or 9% ( 9 % ) , compared to 2010 . the increase primarily was attributable to approximately $ 115 million of higher operating profit on c-130 programs due to increased volume and the retirement of risks ; increased volume and risk retirements on f-16 programs of about $ 50 million and c-5 programs of approximately $ 20 million ; and about $ 70 million due to risk retirements on other aeronautics sustainment activities in 2011 . these increases partially were offset by a decline in operating profit of approximately $ 75 million on the f-22 program and f-35 development contract primarily due to lower volume and about $ 55 million on other programs , including f-35 lrip , primarily due to lower profit rate adjustments in 2011 compared to 2010 . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit rate adjustments described above , were approximately $ 90 million higher in 2011 compared to 2010 . backlog backlog decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to lower orders on f-35 contracts and c-130 programs , partially offset by higher orders on f-16 programs . backlog increased in 2011 compared to 2010 mainly due to higher orders on f-35 contracts , which partially were offset by higher sales volume on the c-130 programs . trends we expect aeronautics will experience a mid single digit percentage range decline in net sales for 2013 as compared to 2012 . a decrease in net sales from a decline in f-16 and c-130j aircraft deliveries is expected to be partially offset by an increase in net sales volume on f-35 lrip contracts . operating profit is projected to decrease at a high single digit percentage range from 2012 levels due to the expected decline in net sales as well as changes in aircraft mix , resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years . information systems & global solutions our is&gs business segment provides management services , integrated information technology solutions , and advanced technology systems and expertise across a broad spectrum of applications for civil , defense , intelligence , and other government customers . is&gs has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments . is&gs has been impacted by the continuing downturn in the federal information technology budgets and the impact of the continuing resolution that was effective on october 1 , 2012 , the start of the u.s . government 2019s fiscal year . is&gs 2019 operating results included the following ( in millions ) : . 2012 compared to 2011 is&gs 2019 net sales for 2012 decreased $ 535 million , or 6% ( 6 % ) , compared to 2011 . the decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately $ 485 million due to the substantial completion of various programs during 2011 ( primarily jtrs ; odin ; and u.k . census ) ; and about $ 255 million due to lower volume on numerous other programs ( primarily hanford ; warfighter information network-tactical ( win-t ) ; command , control , battle management and communications ( c2bmc ) ; and transportation worker identification credential ( twic ) ) . partially offsetting the decreases were higher net sales of approximately $ 140 million from qtc , which was acquired early in the fourth quarter of 2011 ; and about $ 65 million from increased activity on numerous other programs , primarily federal cyber security programs and persistent threat detection system ( ptds ) operational support . is&gs 2019 operating profit for 2012 decreased $ 66 million , or 8% ( 8 % ) , compared to 2011 . the decrease was attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $ 50 million due to the favorable impact of the odin contract completion in 2011 ; about $ 25 million due to an increase in reserves for performance issues related to an international airborne surveillance system in 2012 ; and approximately $ 20 million due to lower volume on certain programs ( primarily c2bmc and win-t ) . partially offsetting the decreases was an increase in operating profit due to higher risk retirements of approximately $ 15 million from the twic program ; and about $ 10 million due to increased activity on numerous other programs , primarily federal cyber security programs and ptds operational support . operating profit for the jtrs program was comparable as a decrease in volume was offset by a decrease in reserves . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above , were approximately $ 20 million higher for 2012 compared to 2011. .

( 3 ) ebitda is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense , income tax expense , depreciation and amortization . adjusted ebitda , which is a measure defined in our credit agreements , means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below . we have included a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda in the table below . both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are considered non-gaap financial measures . generally , a non-gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company 2019s performance , financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap . non-gaap measures used by us may differ from similar measures used by other companies , even when similar terms are used to identify such measures . we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service , capital expenditures and working capital requirements . adjusted ebitda is also the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our senior secured term loan facility ( 201cterm loan 201d ) , including the excess cash flow payment provision , the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio . these covenants and definitions are material components of the term loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the term loan , our ability to make certain investments , incur additional debt , and make restricted payments , such as dividends and share repurchases , as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the term loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments . for further details regarding the term loan , see note 8 ( long-term debt ) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements . the following unaudited table sets forth reconciliations of net income to ebitda and ebitda to adjusted ebitda for the periods presented: . net loss on extinguishment of long-term debt ( a ) 24.3 90.7 64.0 17.2 118.9 loss ( income ) from equity investments ( b ) 10.1 ( 2.2 ) ( 0.6 ) ( 0.3 ) ( 0.1 ) acquisition and integration expenses ( c ) 10.2 2014 2014 2014 2014 gain on remeasurement of equity investment ( d ) ( 98.1 ) 2014 2014 2014 2014 other adjustments ( e ) 6.9 9.2 82.7 23.9 21.6 adjusted ebitda ( f ) $ 1018.5 $ 907.0 $ 808.5 $ 766.6 $ 717.3 ( a ) during the years ended december 31 , 2015 , 2014 , 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , we recorded net losses on extinguishments of long-term debt . the losses represented the difference between the amount paid upon extinguishment , including call premiums and expenses paid to the debt holders and agents , and the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt , adjusted for a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs . ( b ) represents our share of net income/loss from our equity investments . our 35% ( 35 % ) share of kelway 2019s net loss includes our 35% ( 35 % ) share of an expense related to certain equity awards granted by one of the sellers to kelway coworkers in july 2015 prior to the acquisition .

through current cash balances and cash from oper- ations . additionally , the company has existing credit facilities totaling $ 2.5 billion . the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31 , 2012 . the company 2019s financial covenants require the maintenance of a minimum net worth of $ 9 billion and a total debt-to- capital ratio of less than 60% ( 60 % ) . net worth is defined as the sum of common stock , paid-in capital and retained earnings , less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges . the calcu- lation also excludes accumulated other compre- hensive income/loss and nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities . the total debt- to-capital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth . at december 31 , 2012 , international paper 2019s net worth was $ 13.9 bil- lion , and the total-debt-to-capital ratio was 42% ( 42 % ) . the company will continue to rely upon debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows . funding decisions will be guided by our capi- tal structure planning objectives . the primary goals of the company 2019s capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while reducing interest expense . the majority of international paper 2019s debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors . maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper 2019s financing strategy . at december 31 , 2012 , the company held long-term credit ratings of bbb ( stable outlook ) and baa3 ( stable outlook ) by s&p and moody 2019s , respectively . contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31 , 2012 , were as follows: . ( a ) total debt includes scheduled principal payments only . ( b ) represents debt obligations borrowed from non-consolidated variable interest entities for which international paper has , and intends to effect , a legal right to offset these obligations with investments held in the entities . accordingly , in its con- solidated balance sheet at december 31 , 2012 , international paper has offset approximately $ 5.2 billion of interests in the entities against this $ 5.2 billion of debt obligations held by the entities ( see note 11 variable interest entities and preferred securities of subsidiaries on pages 69 through 72 in item 8 . financial statements and supplementary data ) . ( c ) includes $ 3.6 billion relating to fiber supply agreements entered into at the time of the 2006 transformation plan forest- land sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of weyerhaeuser company 2019s containerboard , packaging and recycling business . ( d ) not included in the above table due to the uncertainty as to the amount and timing of the payment are unrecognized tax bene- fits of approximately $ 620 million . we consider the undistributed earnings of our for- eign subsidiaries as of december 31 , 2012 , to be indefinitely reinvested and , accordingly , no u.s . income taxes have been provided thereon . as of december 31 , 2012 , the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $ 840 million . we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to sat- isfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business , including liquidity needs asso- ciated with our domestic debt service requirements . pension obligations and funding at december 31 , 2012 , the projected benefit obliga- tion for the company 2019s u.s . defined benefit plans determined under u.s . gaap was approximately $ 4.1 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets . approximately $ 3.7 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding require- ments . under current irs funding rules , the calcu- lation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits ( the projected benefit obligation ) for accounting purposes . in december 2008 , the worker , retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 ( wera ) was passed by the u.s . congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections . funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company , and the timing of its implementation , as well as on actual demo- graphic data and the targeted funding level . the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected to make voluntary contributions totaling $ 44 million and $ 300 million for the years ended december 31 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively . at this time , we expect that required contributions to its plans in 2013 will be approximately $ 31 million , although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions . the timing and amount of future contributions , which could be material , will depend on a number of factors , including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates . ilim holding s.a . shareholder 2019s agreement in october 2007 , in connection with the for- mation of the ilim holding s.a . joint venture , international paper entered into a share- holder 2019s agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners . this agreement provides that at .

2011 compared to 2010 mfc 2019s net sales for 2011 increased $ 533 million , or 8% ( 8 % ) , compared to 2010 . the increase was attributable to higher volume of about $ 420 million on air and missile defense programs ( primarily pac-3 and thaad ) ; and about $ 245 million from fire control systems programs primarily related to the sof clss program , which began late in the third quarter of 2010 . partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales due to decreased volume of approximately $ 75 million primarily from various services programs and approximately $ 20 million from tactical missile programs ( primarily mlrs and jassm ) . mfc 2019s operating profit for 2011 increased $ 96 million , or 10% ( 10 % ) , compared to 2010 . the increase was attributable to higher operating profit of about $ 60 million for air and missile defense programs ( primarily pac-3 and thaad ) as a result of increased volume and retirement of risks ; and approximately $ 25 million for various services programs . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit rate adjustments described above , were approximately $ 35 million higher in 2011 compared to 2010 . backlog backlog increased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to increased orders and lower sales on fire control systems programs ( primarily lantirn ae and sniper ae ) and on various services programs , partially offset by lower orders and higher sales volume on tactical missiles programs . backlog increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased orders on air and missile defense programs ( primarily thaad ) . trends we expect mfc 2019s net sales for 2013 will be comparable with 2012 . we expect low double digit percentage growth in air and missile defense programs , offset by an expected decline in volume on logistics services programs . operating profit and margin are expected to be comparable with 2012 results . mission systems and training our mst business segment provides surface ship and submarine combat systems ; sea and land-based missile defense systems ; radar systems ; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft ; littoral combat ships ; simulation and training services ; unmanned technologies and platforms ; ship systems integration ; and military and commercial training systems . mst 2019s major programs include aegis , mk-41 vertical launching system ( vls ) , tpq-53 radar system , mh-60 , lcs , and ptds . mst 2019s operating results included the following ( in millions ) : . 2012 compared to 2011 mst 2019s net sales for 2012 increased $ 447 million , or 6% ( 6 % ) , compared to 2011 . the increase in net sales for 2012 was attributable to higher volume and risk retirements of approximately $ 395 million from ship and aviation system programs ( primarily ptds ; lcs ; vls ; and mh-60 ) ; about $ 115 million for training and logistics solutions programs primarily due to net sales from sim industries , which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 ; and approximately $ 30 million as a result of increased volume on integrated warfare systems and sensors programs ( primarily aegis ) . partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately $ 70 million from undersea systems programs due to lower volume on an international combat system program and towed array systems ; and about $ 25 million due to lower volume on various other programs . mst 2019s operating profit for 2012 increased $ 92 million , or 14% ( 14 % ) , compared to 2011 . the increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $ 175 million from ship and aviation system programs , which reflects higher volume and risk retirements on certain programs ( primarily vls ; ptds ; mh-60 ; and lcs ) and reserves of about $ 55 million for contract cost matters on ship and aviation system programs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 ( including the terminated presidential helicopter program ) . partially offsetting the increase was lower operating profit of approximately $ 40 million from undersea systems programs due to reduced profit booking rates on certain programs and lower volume on an international combat system program and towed array systems ; and about $ 40 million due to lower volume on various other programs . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above , were approximately $ 150 million higher for 2012 compared to 2011. .

( see note 6 ) the company also has several unfunded noncontributory supplemental non-qualified pension plans that provide additional retirement benefits to certain employees . the company maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing varying levels of medical and life insurance to eligible retirees . the retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after january 1 , 2006 . the plans had previously closed for non-union employees hired on or after january 1 , 2002 . the company 2019s policy is to fund other postretirement benefit costs for rate-making purposes . plan assets are invested in equity and bond mutual funds , fixed income securities , real estate investment trusts ( 201creits 201d ) and emerging market funds . the obligations of the plans are dominated by obligations for active employees . because the timing of expected benefit payments is so far in the future and the size of the plan assets are small relative to the company 2019s assets , the investment strategy is to allocate a significant percentage of assets to equities , which the company believes will provide the highest return over the long-term period . the fixed income assets are invested in long duration debt securities and may be invested in fixed income instruments , such as futures and options in order to better match the duration of the plan liability. .

continued investments in ecommerce and technology . the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2017 was partially offset by the impact of store closures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 . membership and other income was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 and increased $ 1.0 billion a0for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year . while fiscal 2018 included a $ 387 million gain from the sale of suburbia , a $ 47 million gain from a land sale , higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and higher membership income from increased plus member penetration at sam's club , these gains were less than gains recognized in fiscal 2017 . fiscal 2017 included a $ 535 million gain from the sale of our yihaodian business and a $ 194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in chile . for fiscal 2018 , loss on extinguishment of debt was a0$ 3.1 billion , due to the early extinguishment of long-term debt which allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods . our effective income tax rate was 30.4% ( 30.4 % ) for fiscal 2018 and 30.3% ( 30.3 % ) for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 . although relatively consistent year-over-year , our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from period to period as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies , valuation allowances , changes in tax laws , outcomes of administrative audits , the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our u.s . operations and international operations . the reconciliation from the u.s . statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 is presented in note 9 in the ""notes to consolidated financial statements"" and describes the impact of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ( the ""tax act"" ) to the fiscal 2018 effective income tax rate . as a result of the factors discussed above , we reported $ 10.5 billion and $ 14.3 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively , which represents a decrease of $ 3.8 billion and $ 0.8 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively , when compared to the previous fiscal year . diluted net income per common share attributable to walmart ( ""eps"" ) was $ 3.28 and $ 4.38 for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively . walmart u.s . segment . net sales for the walmart u.s . segment increased $ 10.6 billion or 3.5% ( 3.5 % ) and $ 9.5 billion or 3.2% ( 3.2 % ) for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively , when compared to the previous fiscal year . the increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 2.1% ( 2.1 % ) and 1.6% ( 1.6 % ) for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively , and year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 0.7% ( 0.7 % ) and 1.4% ( 1.4 % ) for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively . additionally , for fiscal 2018 , sales generated from ecommerce acquisitions further contributed to the year-over-year increase . gross profit rate decreased 24 basis points for fiscal 2018 and increased 24 basis points for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year . for fiscal 2018 , the decrease was primarily due to strategic price investments and the mix impact from ecommerce . partially offsetting the negative factors for fiscal 2018 was the positive impact of savings from procuring merchandise . for fiscal 2017 , the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food and consumables , including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower transportation expense from lower fuel costs . operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 and increased 101 basis points for fiscal 2017 , when compared to the previous fiscal year . fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 included charges related to discontinued real estate projects of $ 244 million and $ 249 million , respectively . for fiscal 2017 , the increase was primarily driven by an increase in wage expense due to the investment in the associate wage structure ; the charge related to discontinued real estate projects ; and investments in digital retail and technology . the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2017 was partially offset by the impact of store closures in fiscal 2016 . as a result of the factors discussed above , segment operating income increased $ 124 million for fiscal 2018 and decreased $ 1.3 billion for fiscal 2017 , respectively. .

Step 1: Identify the total number of shares repurchased in the last three months of 2016. From the table, this is 4,823,020 shares.
Step 2: Identify the average price paid per share. From the table, this is $22.87.
Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the repurchased shares by multiplying the total number of shares by the average price per share. This gives 4,823,020 * 22.87 = $110,271,547.4.
Step 4: The treasury stock is increased by the cost of the repurchased shares, so the treasury stock is affected by an increase of $110,271,547.4 million.

Step 1: Identify the number of additional shares to be issued. From the narrative, we know that the awards which shall be settled in shares of common stock represent rights to an additional 2,721,405 shares.
Step 2: Identify the closing stock price in 2014. From the narrative, we know that the 2014 closing stock price was $20.77.
Step 3: Calculate the total value of the award for the additional shares by multiplying the number of shares by the stock price. Total value = 2,721,405 shares * $20.77/share = $56,464,901.85. Since the question asks for the value in millions, we divide this by 1,000,000 to get $56.46 million.

devon energy corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements 2013 ( continued ) proved undeveloped reserves the following table presents the changes in devon 2019s total proved undeveloped reserves during 2015 ( mmboe ) . . proved undeveloped reserves decreased 45% ( 45 % ) from year-end 2014 to year-end 2015 , and the year-end 2015 balance represents 17% ( 17 % ) of total proved reserves . drilling and development activities increased devon 2019s proved undeveloped reserves 24 mmboe and resulted in the conversion of 182 mmboe , or 26% ( 26 % ) , of the 2014 proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves . costs incurred to develop and convert devon 2019s proved undeveloped reserves were approximately $ 2.2 billion for 2015 . additionally , revisions other than price decreased devon 2019s proved undeveloped reserves 120 mmboe primarily due to evaluations of certain properties in the u.s . and canada . the largest revisions , which reduced reserves by 80 mmboe , relate to evaluations of jackfish bitumen reserves . of the 40 mmboe revisions recorded for u.s . properties , a reduction of approximately 27 mmboe represents reserves that devon now does not expect to develop in the next five years , including 20 mmboe attributable to the eagle ford . a significant amount of devon 2019s proved undeveloped reserves at the end of 2015 related to its jackfish operations . at december 31 , 2015 and 2014 , devon 2019s jackfish proved undeveloped reserves were 301 mmboe and 384 mmboe , respectively . development schedules for the jackfish reserves are primarily controlled by the need to keep the processing plants at their 35 mbbl daily facility capacity . processing plant capacity is controlled by factors such as total steam processing capacity and steam-oil ratios . furthermore , development of these projects involves the up-front construction of steam injection/distribution and bitumen processing facilities . due to the large up-front capital investments and large reserves required to provide economic returns , the project conditions meet the specific circumstances requiring a period greater than 5 years for conversion to developed reserves . as a result , these reserves are classified as proved undeveloped for more than five years . currently , the development schedule for these reserves extends through to 2030 . at the end of 2015 , approximately 184 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at jackfish have remained undeveloped for five years or more since the initial booking . no other projects have proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped more than five years from the initial booking of the reserves . furthermore , approximately 180 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at jackfish will require in excess of five years , from the date of this filing , to develop . price revisions 2015 2013 reserves decreased 302 mmboe primarily due to lower commodity prices across all products . the lower bitumen price increased canadian reserves due to the decline in royalties , which increases devon 2019s after- royalty volumes . 2014 2013 reserves increased 9 mmboe primarily due to higher gas prices in the barnett shale and the anadarko basin , partially offset by higher bitumen prices , which result in lower after-royalty volumes , in canada. .

citigroup 2019s repurchases are primarily from government sponsored entities . the specific representations and warranties made by the company depend on the nature of the transaction and the requirements of the buyer . market conditions and credit-ratings agency requirements may also affect representations and warranties and the other provisions the company may agree to in loan sales . in the event of a breach of the representations and warranties , the company may be required to either repurchase the mortgage loans ( generally at unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest ) with the identified defects or indemnify ( 201cmake-whole 201d ) the investor or insurer . the company has recorded a repurchase reserve that is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet . in the case of a repurchase , the company will bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans . the company 2019s representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits in amount or time of coverage . however , contractual liability arises only when the representations and warranties are breached and generally only when a loss results from the breach . in the case of a repurchase , the loan is typically considered a credit- impaired loan and accounted for under sop 03-3 , 201caccounting for certain loans and debt securities , acquired in a transfer 201d ( now incorporated into asc 310-30 , receivables 2014loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality ) . these repurchases have not had a material impact on nonperforming loan statistics , because credit-impaired purchased sop 03-3 loans are not included in nonaccrual loans . the company estimates its exposure to losses from its obligation to repurchase previously sold loans based on the probability of repurchase or make-whole and an estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole . this estimate is calculated separately by sales vintage ( i.e. , the year the loans were sold ) based on a combination of historical trends and forecasted repurchases and losses considering the : ( 1 ) trends in requests by investors for loan documentation packages to be reviewed ; ( 2 ) trends in recent repurchases and make-wholes ; ( 3 ) historical percentage of claims made as a percentage of loan documentation package requests ; ( 4 ) success rate in appealing claims ; ( 5 ) inventory of unresolved claims ; and ( 6 ) estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole , including the loss of principal , accrued interest , and foreclosure costs . the company does not change its estimation methodology by counterparty , but the historical experience and trends are considered when evaluating the overall reserve . the request for loan documentation packages is an early indicator of a potential claim . during 2009 , loan documentation package requests and the level of outstanding claims increased . in addition , our loss severity estimates increased during 2009 due to the impact of macroeconomic factors and recent experience . these factors contributed to a $ 493 million change in estimate for this reserve in 2009 . as indicated above , the repurchase reserve is calculated by sales vintage . the majority of the repurchases in 2009 were from the 2006 and 2007 sales vintages , which also represent the vintages with the largest loss- given-repurchase . an insignificant percentage of 2009 repurchases were from vintages prior to 2006 , and this is expected to decrease , because those vintages are later in the credit cycle . although early in the credit cycle , the company has experienced improved repurchase and loss-given-repurchase statistics from the 2008 and 2009 vintages . in the case of a repurchase of a credit-impaired sop 03-3 loan ( now incorporated into asc 310-30 ) , the difference between the loan 2019s fair value and unpaid principal balance at the time of the repurchase is recorded as a utilization of the repurchase reserve . payments to make the investor whole are also treated as utilizations and charged directly against the reserve . the provision for estimated probable losses arising from loan sales is recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale , which is included in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income . a liability for representations and warranties is estimated when the company sells loans and is updated quarterly . any subsequent adjustment to the provision is recorded in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income . the activity in the repurchase reserve for the years ended december 31 , 2009 and 2008 is as follows: . goodwill goodwill represents an acquired company 2019s acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired . goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests , whereby goodwill is allocated to the company 2019s reporting units and an impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value . furthermore , on any business dispositions , goodwill is allocated to the business disposed of based on the ratio of the fair value of the business disposed of to the fair value of the reporting unit . intangible assets intangible assets 2014including core deposit intangibles , present value of future profits , purchased credit card relationships , other customer relationships , and other intangible assets , but excluding msrs 2014are amortized over their estimated useful lives . intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives , primarily certain asset management contracts and trade names , are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests . an impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value . for other intangible assets subject to amortization , an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset . other assets and other liabilities other assets include , among other items , loans held-for-sale , deferred tax assets , equity-method investments , interest and fees receivable , premises and equipment , end-user derivatives in a net receivable position , repossessed assets , and other receivables. .

item 7a . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ( amounts in millions ) in the normal course of business , we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates , foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items . from time to time , we use derivative instruments , pursuant to established guidelines and policies , to manage some portion of these risks . derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes . interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations . the majority of our debt ( approximately 91% ( 91 % ) and 86% ( 86 % ) as of december 31 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively ) bears interest at fixed rates . we do have debt with variable interest rates , but a 10% ( 10 % ) increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows . the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates , and the impact of a 10% ( 10 % ) change in interest rates is summarized below . increase/ ( decrease ) in fair market value as of december 31 , 10% ( 10 % ) increase in interest rates 10% ( 10 % ) decrease in interest rates . we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates . we do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 , 2014 . we had $ 1667.2 of cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 , 2014 that we generally invest in conservative , short-term bank deposits or securities . the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements . during 2014 and 2013 , we had interest income of $ 27.4 and $ 24.7 , respectively . based on our 2014 results , a 100-basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $ 16.7 , assuming that all cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2014 levels . foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates . since we report revenues and expenses in u.s . dollars , changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses ( as expressed in u.s . dollars ) from foreign operations . the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2014 included the argentine peso , australian dollar , brazilian real and british pound sterling . based on 2014 exchange rates and operating results , if the u.s . dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10% ( 10 % ) , we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4% ( 4 % ) , assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2014 levels . the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency . assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date , and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented . the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss , net of tax , in the stockholders 2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets . our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency , mitigating transaction risk . however , certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency . assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement . currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses . we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. .

discount rate 2014the assumed discount rate is used to determine the current retirement related benefit plan expense and obligations , and represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to effectively settle a plan 2019s benefit obligations . the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate . benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan , but also on the underlying participant demographics , including current age , and assumed mortality . we use only bonds that are denominated in u.s . dollars , rated aa or better by two of three nationally recognized statistical rating agencies , have a minimum outstanding issue of $ 50 million as of the measurement date , and are not callable , convertible , or index linked . since bond yields are generally unavailable beyond 30 years , we assume those rates will remain constant beyond that point . taking into consideration the factors noted above , our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 5.23% ( 5.23 % ) and 5.84% ( 5.84 % ) , as of december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 4.94% ( 4.94 % ) and 5.58% ( 5.58 % ) as of december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . expected long-term rate of return 2014the expected long-term rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense , and is based on such factors as historical returns , targeted asset allocations , investment policy , duration , expected future long-term performance of individual asset classes , inflation trends , portfolio volatility , and risk management strategies . while studies are helpful in understanding current trends and performance , the assumption is based more on longer term and prospective views . in order to reflect expected lower future market returns , we have reduced the expected long-term rate of return assumption from 8.50% ( 8.50 % ) , used to record 2011 expense , to 8.00% ( 8.00 % ) for 2012 . the decrease in the expected return on assets assumption is primarily related to lower bond yields and updated return assumptions for equities . unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year , the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year . an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions : ( $ in millions ) increase ( decrease ) in 2012 expense increase ( decrease ) in december 31 , 2011 obligations . differences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status . actuarial gains and losses arising from differences from actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income . this unrecognized amount is amortized to the extent it exceeds 10% ( 10 % ) of the greater of the plan 2019s benefit obligation or plan assets . the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants , which is approximately 10 years . cas expense 2014in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs , cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods . while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar , the pattern of cost recognition is different . the key drivers of cas pension expense include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans as well as our expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption . unlike fas , cas requires the discount rate to be consistent with the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption , which changes infrequently given its long-term nature . as a result , changes in bond or other interest rates generally do not impact cas . in addition , unlike under fas , we can only allocate pension costs for a plan under cas until such plan is fully funded as determined under erisa requirements . other fas and cas considerations 2014we update our estimates of future fas and cas costs at least annually based on factors such as calendar year actual plan asset returns , final census data from the end of the prior year , and other actual and projected experience . a key driver of the difference between fas and cas expense ( and consequently , the fas/cas adjustment ) is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements . under fas , our net gains and losses exceeding the 10% ( 10 % ) corridor are amortized .

volatility environment in 2017 . in investment banking , industry-wide mergers and acquisitions volumes increased compared with 2017 , while industry-wide underwriting transactions decreased . our other principal transactions revenues benefited from company-specific events , including sales , and strong corporate performance , while investments in public equities reflected losses , as global equity prices generally decreased in 2018 , particularly towards the end of the year . in investment management , our assets under supervision increased reflecting net inflows in liquidity products , fixed income assets and equity assets , partially offset by depreciation in client assets , primarily in equity assets . if market-making or investment banking activity levels decline , or assets under supervision decline , or asset prices continue to decline , net revenues would likely be negatively impacted . see 201csegment operating results 201d for further information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations . during 2017 , generally higher asset prices and tighter credit spreads were supportive of industry-wide underwriting activities , investment management performance and other principal transactions . however , low levels of volatility in equity , fixed income , currency and commodity markets continued to negatively affect our market-making activities . 2018 versus 2017 net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 36.62 billion for 2018 , 12% ( 12 % ) higher than 2017 , primarily due

for fiscal year 2005 , the effective tax rate includes the impact of $ 11.6 million tax expense associated with repatriation of approximately $ 185.0 million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 . for fiscal year 2004 , the effective tax rate reflects the tax benefit derived from higher earnings in low-tax jurisdictions . during fiscal year 2006 , primarily due to a tax accounting method change , there was a decrease of $ 83.2 million in the current deferred tax assets , and a corresponding increase in non-current deferred tax assets . in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 , we changed our tax accounting method on our tax return for fiscal year 2005 with respect to the current portion of deferred revenue to follow the recognition of revenue under u.s . generally accepted accounting principles . this accounting method change , as well as other adjustments made to our taxable income upon the filing of the fiscal year 2005 tax return , resulted in an increase in our operating loss ( nol ) carryforwards . in may 2006 , the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2005 was enacted , which provides a three-year exception to current u.s . taxation of certain foreign intercompany income . this provision will first apply to synopsys in fiscal year 2007 . management estimates that had such provisions been applied for fiscal 2006 , our income tax expense would have been reduced by approximately $ 3 million . in december 2006 , the tax relief and health care act of 2006 was enacted , which retroactively extended the research and development credit from january 1 , 2006 . as a result , we will record an expected increase in our fiscal 2006 research and development credit of between $ 1.5 million and $ 1.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 . revision of prior year financial statements . as part of our remediation of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting identified in fiscal 2005 relating to accounting for income taxes we implemented additional internal control and review procedures . through such procedures , in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 , we identified four errors totaling $ 8.2 million which affected our income tax provision in fiscal years 2001 through 2005 . we concluded that these errors were not material to any prior year financial statements . although the errors are not material to prior periods , we elected to revise prior year financial statements to correct such errors . the fiscal periods in which the errors originated , and the resulting change in provision ( benefit ) for income taxes for each year , are reflected in the following table : year ended october 31 ( in thousands ) . the errors were as follows : ( 1 ) synopsys inadvertently provided a $ 1.4 million tax benefit for the write- off of goodwill relating to an acquisition in fiscal 2002 ; ( 2 ) synopsys did not accrue interest and penalties for certain foreign tax contingency items in the amount of $ 3.2 million ; ( 3 ) synopsys made certain computational errors relating to foreign dividends of $ 2.3 million ; and ( 4 ) synopsys did not record a valuation allowance relating to certain state tax credits of $ 1.3 million . as result of this revision , non-current deferred tax assets decreased by $ 8.1 million and current taxes payable increased by $ 0.2 million . retained earnings decreased by $ 8.2 million and additional paid in capital decreased by $ 0.1 million . see item 9a . controls and procedures for a further discussion of our remediation of the material weakness . tax effects of stock awards . in november 2005 , fasb issued a staff position ( fsp ) on fas 123 ( r ) -3 , transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share-based payment awards . effective upon issuance , this fsp describes an alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation pursuant to sfas 123 ( r ) . the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool ( apic pool ) related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation , and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee share-based compensation .

in september 2007 , we reached a settlement with the united states department of justice in an ongoing investigation into financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting orthopaedic surgeons . under the terms of the settlement , we paid a civil settlement amount of $ 169.5 million and we recorded an expense in that amount . no tax benefit has been recorded related to the settlement expense due to the uncertainty as to the tax treatment . we intend to pursue resolution of this uncertainty with taxing authorities , but are unable to ascertain the outcome or timing for such resolution at this time . for more information regarding the settlement , see note 15 . in june 2006 , the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) issued interpretation no . 48 , accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 2013 an interpretation of fasb statement no . 109 , accounting for income taxes ( fin 48 ) . fin 48 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements . under fin 48 , we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities , based on the technical merits of the position . the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement . fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition , classification , interest and penalties on income taxes , accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures . we adopted fin 48 on january 1 , 2007 . prior to the adoption of fin 48 we had a long term tax liability for expected settlement of various federal , state and foreign income tax liabilities that was reflected net of the corollary tax impact of these expected settlements of $ 102.1 million , as well as a separate accrued interest liability of $ 1.7 million . as a result of the adoption of fin 48 , we are required to present the different components of such liability on a gross basis versus the historical net presentation . the adoption resulted in the financial statement liability for unrecognized tax benefits decreasing by $ 6.4 million as of january 1 , 2007 . the adoption resulted in this decrease in the liability as well as a reduction to retained earnings of $ 4.8 million , a reduction in goodwill of $ 61.4 million , the establishment of a tax receivable of $ 58.2 million , which was recorded in other current and non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheet , and an increase in an interest/penalty payable of $ 7.9 million , all as of january 1 , 2007 . therefore , after the adoption of fin 48 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is $ 95.7 million as of january 1 , 2007 , of which $ 28.6 million would impact our effective tax rate , if recognized . the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is $ 135.2 million as of december 31 , 2007 . of this amount , $ 41.0 million would impact our effective tax rate , if recognized . a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows ( in millions ) : . we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings , which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods . as of january 1 , 2007 , we recorded a liability of $ 9.6 million for accrued interest and penalties , of which $ 7.5 million would impact our effective tax rate , if recognized . the amount of this liability is $ 19.6 million as of december 31 , 2007 . of this amount , $ 14.7 million would impact our effective tax rate , if recognized . we expect that the amount of tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months ; however , we do not expect these changes will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position . the u.s . federal statute of limitations remains open for the year 2003 and onward with years 2003 and 2004 currently under examination by the irs . it is reasonably possible that a resolution with the irs for the years 2003 through 2004 will be reached within the next twelve months , but we do not anticipate this would result in any material impact on our financial position . in addition , for the 1999 tax year of centerpulse , which we acquired in october 2003 , one issue remains in dispute . the resolution of this issue would not impact our effective tax rate , as it would be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill . state income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of 3 to 5 years after filing of the respective return . the state impact of any federal changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the states . we have various state income tax returns in the process of examination , administrative appeals or litigation . it is reasonably possible that such matters will be resolved in the next twelve months , but we do not anticipate that the resolution of these matters would result in any material impact on our results of operations or financial position . foreign jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from 3 to 5 years . years still open to examination by foreign tax authorities in major jurisdictions include australia ( 2003 onward ) , canada ( 1999 onward ) , france ( 2005 onward ) , germany ( 2005 onward ) , italy ( 2003 onward ) , japan ( 2001 onward ) , puerto rico ( 2005 onward ) , singapore ( 2003 onward ) , switzerland ( 2004 onward ) , and the united kingdom ( 2005 onward ) . z i m m e r h o l d i n g s , i n c . 2 0 0 7 f o r m 1 0 - k a n n u a l r e p o r t notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) .

potentially responsible parties , and existing technology , laws , and regulations . the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved , site- specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties , the degree of contamination by various wastes , the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites , and the speculative nature of remediation costs . current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations , financial condition , or liquidity . personal injury 2013 the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year . we use third-party actuaries to assist us with measuring the expense and liability , including unasserted claims . the federal employers 2019 liability act ( fela ) governs compensation for work-related accidents . under fela , damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out-of-court settlements . we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work . annual expenses for personal injury-related events were $ 240 million in 2006 , $ 247 million in 2005 , and $ 288 million in 2004 . as of december 31 , 2006 and 2005 , we had accrued liabilities of $ 631 million and $ 619 million for future personal injury costs , respectively , of which $ 233 million and $ 274 million was recorded in current liabilities as accrued casualty costs , respectively . our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable u.s . treasury rates . approximately 87% ( 87 % ) of the recorded liability related to asserted claims , and approximately 13% ( 13 % ) related to unasserted claims . estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation . our personal injury claims activity was as follows : claims activity 2006 2005 2004 . depreciation 2013 the railroad industry is capital intensive . properties are carried at cost . provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight-line method based on estimated service lives of depreciable property . the lives are calculated using a separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property group , based on the results of internal depreciation studies . we are required to submit a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates to the stb for review and approval every three years for equipment property and every six years for road property . the cost ( net of salvage ) of depreciable railroad property retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation , and no gain or loss is recognized . a gain or loss is recognized in other income for all other property upon disposition because the gain or loss is not part of rail operations . the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and amortized over a five-year period . significant capital spending in recent years increased the total value of our depreciable assets . cash capital spending totaled $ 2.2 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2006 . for the year ended december 31 , 2006 , depreciation expense was $ 1.2 billion . we use various methods to estimate useful lives for each group of depreciable property . due to the capital intensive nature of the business and the large base of depreciable assets , variances to those estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements . if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year , annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately $ 43 million . if the estimated useful lives of all assets to be depreciated were decreased by one year , annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $ 45 million . income taxes 2013 as required under fasb statement no . 109 , accounting for income taxes , we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns . these .

the analysis of our depreciation studies . changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively . under group depreciation , the historical cost ( net of salvage ) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized . the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using ( i ) inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ( ii ) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies . the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes . because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired , we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate . in addition , we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient ( or in excess ) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies . any deficiency ( or excess ) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets . for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business , a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions : ( i ) is unusual , ( ii ) is material in amount , and ( iii ) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies . a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations . when we purchase an asset , we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use . however , many of our assets are self-constructed . a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties , which is typically performed by our employees , and for track line expansion and other capacity projects . costs that are directly attributable to capital projects ( including overhead costs ) are capitalized . direct costs that are capitalized as part of self- constructed assets include material , labor , and work equipment . indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset . general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred . normal repairs and maintenance , including rail grinding , are also expensed as incurred , while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset , improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized . these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases . total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was $ 2.1 billion for 2012 , $ 2.2 billion for 2011 , and $ 2.0 billion for 2010 . assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease . amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease . 12 . accounts payable and other current liabilities dec . 31 , dec . 31 , millions 2012 2011 . .

Step 1: Calculate the return for investing in Applied Materials from 2009 to 2014. 
Initial value in 2009 = 100.00
Final value in 2014 = 183.29
Return for Applied Materials = ((183.29 - 100.00) / 100.00) * 100 = 83.29%

The narrative context does not provide any information about the tax rate associated with the goodwill impairment in 2008. However, the table context mentions that the company recorded a $9.6 billion pretax ($8.7 billion after tax) goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2008. We can use this information to calculate the tax rate.

Step 1: Calculate the tax amount by subtracting the after-tax amount from the pre-tax amount. Tax amount = $9.6 billion - $8.7 billion = $0.9 billion
Step 2: Calculate the tax rate by dividing the tax amount by the pre-tax amount and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. Tax rate = ($0.9 billion / $9.6 billion) * 100

banking ) . the results of the first step of the impairment test showed no indication of impairment in any of the reporting units at any of the periods except december 31 , 2008 and , accordingly , the company did not perform the second step of the impairment test , except for the test performed as of december 31 , 2008 . as of december 31 , 2008 , there was an indication of impairment in the north america consumer banking , latin america consumer banking and emea consumer banking reporting units and , accordingly , the second step of testing was performed on these reporting units . based on the results of the second step of testing , the company recorded a $ 9.6 billion pretax ( $ 8.7 billion after tax ) goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 , representing the entire amount of goodwill allocated to these reporting units . the primary cause for the goodwill impairment in the above reporting units was the rapid deterioration in the financial markets , as well as in the global economic outlook particularly during the period beginning mid-november through year end 2008 . this deterioration further weakened the near-term prospects for the financial services industry . these and other factors , including the increased possibility of further government intervention , also resulted in the decline in the company 2019s market capitalization from approximately $ 90 billion at july 1 , 2008 and approximately $ 74 billion at october 31 , 2008 to approximately $ 36 billion at december 31 , 2008 . the more significant fair-value adjustments in the pro forma purchase price allocation in the second step of testing were to fair-value loans and debt and were made to identify and value identifiable intangibles . the adjustments to measure the assets , liabilities and intangibles were for the purpose of measuring the implied fair value of goodwill and such adjustments are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet . the following table shows reporting units with goodwill balances and the excess of fair value of allocated book value as of december 31 , 2008 . reporting unit ( $ in millions ) fair value as a % (  % ) of allocated book value goodwill ( post-impairment ) . while no impairment was noted in step one of our securities and banking reporting unit impairment test at october 31 , 2008 and december 31 , 2008 , goodwill present in that reporting unit may be particularly sensitive to further deterioration in economic conditions . under the market approach for valuing this reporting unit , the earnings multiples and transaction multiples were selected from multiples obtained using data from guideline companies and acquisitions . the selection of the actual multiple considers operating performance and financial condition such as return on equity and net income growth of securities and banking as compared to the guideline companies and acquisitions . for the valuation under the income approach , the company utilized a discount rate which it believes reflects the risk and uncertainty related to the projected cash flows , and selected 2013 as the terminal year . in 2013 , the value was derived assuming a return to historical levels of core-business profitability for the reporting unit , despite the significant losses experienced in 2008 . this assumption is based on management 2019s view that this recovery will occur based upon various macro- economic factors such as the recent u.s . government stimulus actions , restoring marketplace confidence and improved risk-management practices on an industry-wide basis . furthermore , company-specific actions such as its recently announced realignment of its businesses to optimize its global businesses for future profitable growth , will also be a factor in returning the company 2019s core securities and banking business to historical levels . small deterioration in the assumptions used in the valuations , in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the net income projections , could significantly affect the company 2019s impairment evaluation and , hence , results . if the future were to differ adversely from management 2019s best estimate of key economic assumptions and associated cash flows were to decrease by a small margin , the company could potentially experience future material impairment charges with respect to the goodwill remaining in our securities and banking reporting unit . any such charges by themselves would not negatively affect the company 2019s tier 1 and total regulatory capital ratios , tangible capital or the company 2019s liquidity position. .

entergy corporation and subsidiaries management 2019s financial discussion and analysis net revenue utility following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2014 to 2013 . amount ( in millions ) . the retail electric price variance is primarily due to : 2022 increases in the energy efficiency rider at entergy arkansas , as approved by the apsc , effective july 2013 and july 2014 . energy efficiency revenues are offset by costs included in other operation and maintenance expenses and have minimal effect on net income ; 2022 the effect of the apsc 2019s order in entergy arkansas 2019s 2013 rate case , including an annual base rate increase effective january 2014 offset by a miso rider to provide customers credits in rates for transmission revenue received through miso ; 2022 a formula rate plan increase at entergy mississippi , as approved by the mspc , effective september 2013 ; 2022 an increase in entergy mississippi 2019s storm damage rider , as approved by the mpsc , effective october 2013 . the increase in the storm damage rider is offset by other operation and maintenance expenses and has no effect on net income ; 2022 an annual base rate increase at entergy texas , effective april 2014 , as a result of the puct 2019s order in the september 2013 rate case ; and 2022 a formula rate plan increase at entergy louisiana , as approved by the lpsc , effective december 2014 . see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of rate proceedings . the asset retirement obligation affects net revenue because entergy records a regulatory debit or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation- related costs collected in revenue . the variance is primarily caused by increases in regulatory credits because of decreases in decommissioning trust earnings and increases in depreciation and accretion expenses and increases in regulatory credits to realign the asset retirement obligation regulatory assets with regulatory treatment . the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 3129 gwh , or 3% ( 3 % ) , in billed electricity usage primarily due to an increase in sales to industrial customers and the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales . the increase in industrial sales was primarily due to expansions , recovery of a major refining customer from an unplanned outage in 2013 , and continued moderate growth in the manufacturing sector . the miso deferral variance is primarily due to the deferral in 2014 of the non-fuel miso-related charges , as approved by the lpsc and the mpsc , partially offset by the deferral in april 2013 , as approved by the apsc , of costs incurred from march 2010 through december 2012 related to the transition and implementation of joining the miso .

the analysis of our depreciation studies . changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively . under group depreciation , the historical cost ( net of salvage ) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized . the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using ( i ) inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ( ii ) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies . the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes . because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired , we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate . in addition , we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient ( or in excess ) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies . any deficiency ( or excess ) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets . for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business , a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions : ( i ) is unusual , ( ii ) is material in amount , and ( iii ) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies . a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations . when we purchase an asset , we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use . however , many of our assets are self-constructed . a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties , which is typically performed by our employees , and for track line expansion and other capacity projects . costs that are directly attributable to capital projects ( including overhead costs ) are capitalized . direct costs that are capitalized as part of self- constructed assets include material , labor , and work equipment . indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset . general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred . normal repairs and maintenance are also expensed as incurred , while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset , improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized . these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases . total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was $ 2.3 billion for 2013 , $ 2.1 billion for 2012 , and $ 2.2 billion for 2011 . assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease . amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease . 12 . accounts payable and other current liabilities dec . 31 , dec . 31 , millions 2013 2012 . .

56 / 57 management 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations junior subordinate deferrable interest debentures in june 2005 , we issued $ 100.0 a0million of trust preferred securities , which are reflected on the balance sheet as junior subordinate deferrable interest debentures . the proceeds were used to repay our revolving credit facility . the $ 100.0 a0million of junior subordi- nate deferrable interest debentures have a 30-year term ending july 2035 . they bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.61% ( 5.61 % ) for the first 10 years ending july 2015 . thereafter , the rate will float at three month libor plus 1.25% ( 1.25 % ) . the securities are redeemable at par . restrictive covenants the terms of the 2011 revolving credit facility and certain of our senior unsecured notes include certain restrictions and covenants which may limit , among other things , our ability to pay dividends ( as discussed below ) , make certain types of investments , incur additional indebtedness , incur liens and enter into negative pledge agreements and the disposition of assets , and which require compliance with financial ratios including our minimum tangible net worth , a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value , a minimum ratio of ebitda to fixed charges and a maximum ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value . the dividend restriction referred to above provides that we will not during any time when we are in default , make distributions with respect to common stock or other equity interests , except to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes . as of december a031 , 2011 and 2010 , we were in compli- ance with all such covenants . market rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our floating rate borrowing arrangements . we use interest rate deriv- ative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes . a a0hypothetical 100 a0basis point increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate curve for 2011 and 2010 , would increase our annual interest cost by approximately $ 12.3 a0million and $ 11.0 a0mil- lion and would increase our share of joint venture annual interest cost by approximately $ 4.8 a0million and $ 6.7 a0million , respectively . we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value . derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income . if a derivative is a hedge , depending on the nature of the hedge , changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset , liability , or firm commitment through earnings , or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings . the ineffective portion of a derivative 2019s change in fair value is recognized immediately in earnings . approximately $ 4.8 a0billion of our long- term debt bore interest a0at fixed rates , and therefore the fair value of these instru- ments is affected by changes in the market interest rates . the interest rate on our variable rate debt and joint venture debt as of december a031 , 2011 ranged from libor plus 150 a0basis points to libor plus 350 a0basis points . contractual obligations combined aggregate principal maturities of mortgages and other loans payable , our 2011 revolving credit facility , senior unsecured notes ( net of discount ) , trust preferred securities , our share of joint venture debt , including as- of-right extension options , estimated interest expense ( based on weighted average interest rates for the quarter ) , and our obligations under our capital lease and ground leases , as of december a031 , 2011 are as follows ( in thousands ) : . .

available-for-sale securities and amortization of prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses in actuarial assumptions . treasury stock 2013 we account for repurchases of common stock under the cost method and present treasury stock as a reduction of stockholders 2019 equity . we reissue common stock held in treasury only for limited purposes . noncontrolling interest 2013 in 2011 , we made an investment in a company in which we acquired a controlling financial interest , but not 100 percent of the equity . in 2013 , we purchased additional shares of the company from the minority shareholders . further information related to the noncontrolling interests of that investment has not been provided as it is not significant to our consolidated financial statements . accounting pronouncements 2013 effective january 1 , 2013 , we adopted the fasb 2019s accounting standard updates ( asus ) requiring reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income ( oci ) and balance sheet offsetting between derivative assets and liabilities . these asus only change financial statement disclosure requirements and therefore do not impact our financial position , results of operations or cash flows . see note 12 for disclosures relating to oci . see note 13 for disclosures relating to balance sheet offsetting . there are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that are expected to have a material effect on our financial position , results of operations or cash flows . 3 . share-based compensation our share-based payments primarily consist of stock options , restricted stock , restricted stock units ( rsus ) , and an employee stock purchase plan . share-based compensation expense is as follows ( in millions ) : . share-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory for the years ended december 31 , 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $ 4.1 million , $ 6.1 million , and $ 8.8 million , respectively . as of december 31 , 2013 and 2012 , approximately $ 2.4 million and $ 3.3 million of capitalized costs remained in finished goods inventory . stock options we had two equity compensation plans in effect at december 31 , 2013 : the 2009 stock incentive plan ( 2009 plan ) and the stock plan for non-employee directors . the 2009 plan succeeded the 2006 stock incentive plan ( 2006 plan ) and the teamshare stock option plan ( teamshare plan ) . no further awards have been granted under the 2006 plan or under the teamshare plan since may 2009 , and shares remaining available for grant under those plans have been merged into the 2009 plan . vested and unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock and rsus previously granted under the 2006 plan , the teamshare plan and another prior plan , the 2001 stock incentive plan , remained outstanding as of december 31 , 2013 . we have reserved the maximum number of shares of common stock available for award under the terms of each of these plans . we have registered 57.9 million shares of common stock under these plans . the 2009 plan provides for the grant of nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options , long-term performance awards in the form of performance shares or units , restricted stock , rsus and stock appreciation rights . the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors determines the grant date for annual grants under our equity compensation plans . the date for annual grants under the 2009 plan to our executive officers is expected to occur in the first quarter of each year following the earnings announcements for the previous quarter and full year . the stock plan for non-employee directors provides for awards of stock options , restricted stock and rsus to non-employee directors . it has been our practice to issue shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options from previously unissued shares , except in limited circumstances where they are issued from treasury stock . the total number of awards which may be granted in a given year and/or over the life of the plan under each of our equity compensation plans is limited . at december 31 , 2013 , an aggregate of 10.4 million shares were available for future grants and awards under these plans . stock options granted to date under our plans generally vest over four years and generally have a maximum contractual life of 10 years . as established under our equity compensation plans , vesting may accelerate upon retirement after the first anniversary date of the award if certain criteria are met . we recognize expense related to stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period , less awards expected to be forfeited using estimated forfeiture rates . due to the accelerated retirement provisions , the requisite service period of our stock options range from one to four years . stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant , except in limited circumstances where local law may dictate otherwise. .

management 2019s discussion and analysis the table below presents the operating results of our institutional client services segment. . 1 . includes net revenues related to reinsurance of $ 1.08 billion , $ 880 million and $ 827 million for the years ended december 2012 , december 2011 and december 2010 , respectively . 2012 versus 2011 . net revenues in institutional client services were $ 18.12 billion for 2012 , 5% ( 5 % ) higher than 2011 . net revenues in fixed income , currency and commodities client execution were $ 9.91 billion for 2012 , 10% ( 10 % ) higher than 2011 . these results reflected strong net revenues in mortgages , which were significantly higher compared with 2011 . in addition , net revenues in credit products and interest rate products were solid and higher compared with 2011 . these increases were partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in commodities and slightly lower net revenues in currencies . although broad market concerns persisted during 2012 , fixed income , currency and commodities client execution operated in a generally improved environment characterized by tighter credit spreads and less challenging market-making conditions compared with 2011 . net revenues in equities were $ 8.21 billion for 2012 , essentially unchanged compared with 2011 . net revenues in securities services were significantly higher compared with 2011 , reflecting a gain of approximately $ 500 million on the sale of our hedge fund administration business . in addition , equities client execution net revenues were higher than 2011 , primarily reflecting significantly higher results in cash products , principally due to increased levels of client activity . these increases were offset by lower commissions and fees , reflecting lower market volumes . during 2012 , equities operated in an environment generally characterized by an increase in global equity prices and lower volatility levels . the net loss attributable to the impact of changes in our own credit spreads on borrowings for which the fair value option was elected was $ 714 million ( $ 433 million and $ 281 million related to fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution , respectively ) for 2012 , compared with a net gain of $ 596 million ( $ 399 million and $ 197 million related to fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution , respectively ) for 2011 . during 2012 , institutional client services operated in an environment generally characterized by continued broad market concerns and uncertainties , although positive developments helped to improve market conditions . these developments included certain central bank actions to ease monetary policy and address funding risks for european financial institutions . in addition , the u.s . economy posted stable to improving economic data , including favorable developments in unemployment and housing . these improvements resulted in tighter credit spreads , higher global equity prices and lower levels of volatility . however , concerns about the outlook for the global economy and continued political uncertainty , particularly the political debate in the united states surrounding the fiscal cliff , generally resulted in client risk aversion and lower activity levels . also , uncertainty over financial regulatory reform persisted . if these concerns and uncertainties continue over the long term , net revenues in fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities would likely be negatively impacted . operating expenses were $ 12.48 billion for 2012 , 3% ( 3 % ) lower than 2011 , primarily due to lower brokerage , clearing , exchange and distribution fees , and lower impairment charges , partially offset by higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings . pre-tax earnings were $ 5.64 billion in 2012 , 27% ( 27 % ) higher than 2011 . 2011 versus 2010 . net revenues in institutional client services were $ 17.28 billion for 2011 , 21% ( 21 % ) lower than 2010 . net revenues in fixed income , currency and commodities client execution were $ 9.02 billion for 2011 , 34% ( 34 % ) lower than 2010 . although activity levels during 2011 were generally consistent with 2010 levels , and results were solid during the first quarter of 2011 , the environment during the remainder of 2011 was characterized by broad market concerns and uncertainty , resulting in volatile markets and significantly wider credit spreads , which contributed to difficult market-making conditions and led to reductions in risk by us and our clients . as a result of these conditions , net revenues across the franchise were lower , including significant declines in mortgages and credit products , compared with 2010 . 54 goldman sachs 2012 annual report .

the aes corporation notes to consolidated financial statements 2014 ( continued ) december 31 , 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 the following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for the periods indicated ( in millions ) : . the company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently under examination by the relevant taxing authorities for various tax years . the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded . while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position , we believe we have appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits . however , audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty . it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could be material , but cannot be estimated as of december 31 , 2018 . our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted . 22 . discontinued operations due to a portfolio evaluation in the first half of 2016 , management decided to pursue a strategic shift of its distribution companies in brazil , sul and eletropaulo , to reduce the company's exposure to the brazilian distribution market . the disposals of sul and eletropaulo were completed in october 2016 and june 2018 , respectively . eletropaulo 2014 in november 2017 , eletropaulo converted its preferred shares into ordinary shares and transitioned the listing of those shares to the novo mercado , which is a listing segment of the brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance . upon conversion of the preferred shares into ordinary shares , aes no longer controlled eletropaulo , but maintained significant influence over the business . as a result , the company deconsolidated eletropaulo . after deconsolidation , the company's 17% ( 17 % ) ownership interest was reflected as an equity method investment . the company recorded an after-tax loss on deconsolidation of $ 611 million , which primarily consisted of $ 455 million related to cumulative translation losses and $ 243 million related to pension losses reclassified from aocl . in december 2017 , all the remaining criteria were met for eletropaulo to qualify as a discontinued operation . therefore , its results of operations and financial position were reported as such in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented . in june 2018 , the company completed the sale of its entire 17% ( 17 % ) ownership interest in eletropaulo through a bidding process hosted by the brazilian securities regulator , cvm . gross proceeds of $ 340 million were received at our subsidiary in brazil , subject to the payment of taxes . upon disposal of eletropaulo , the company recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $ 243 million ( after-tax $ 199 million ) . excluding the gain on sale , eletropaulo's pre-tax loss attributable to aes was immaterial for the year ended december 31 , 2018 . eletropaulo's pre-tax loss attributable to aes , including the loss on deconsolidation , for the years ended december 31 , 2017 and 2016 was $ 633 million and $ 192 million , respectively . prior to its classification as discontinued operations , eletropaulo was reported in the south america sbu reportable segment . sul 2014 the company executed an agreement for the sale of sul , a wholly-owned subsidiary , in june 2016 . the results of operations and financial position of sul are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented . upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria , the company recognized an after-tax loss of $ 382 million comprised of a pre-tax impairment charge of $ 783 million , offset by a tax benefit of $ 266 million related to the impairment of the sul long lived assets and a tax benefit of $ 135 million for deferred taxes related to the investment in sul . prior to the impairment charge , the carrying value of the sul asset group of $ 1.6 billion was greater than its approximate fair value less costs to sell . however , the impairment charge was limited to the carrying value of the long lived assets of the sul disposal group. .

put options we currently have outstanding put option agreements with other shareholders of our air products san fu company , ltd . and indura s.a . subsidiaries . the put options give the shareholders the right to sell stock in the subsidiaries based on pricing terms in the agreements . refer to note 17 , commitments and contingencies , to the consolidated financial statements for additional information . due to the uncertainty of whether these options would be exercised and the related timing , we excluded the potential payments from the contractual obligations table . pension benefits we sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees . the principal defined benefit pension plans 2014the u.s . salaried pension plan and the u.k . pension plan 2014were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans . over the long run , the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions . for 2013 , the fair market value of pension plan assets for our defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to $ 3800.8 from $ 3239.1 in 2012 . the projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was $ 4394.0 and $ 4486.5 in 2013 and 2012 , respectively . refer to note 16 , retirement benefits , to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits . pension expense . 2013 vs . 2012 the increase in pension expense , excluding special items , was primarily attributable to the 100 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate , resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses . the increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets and contributions in 2013 . special items of $ 19.8 primarily included $ 12.4 for pension settlement losses and $ 6.9 for special termination benefits relating to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan . 2012 vs . 2011 pension expense in 2012 , excluding special items , was comparable to 2011 expense as a result of no change in the weighted average discount rate from year to year . 2014 outlook pension expense is estimated to be approximately $ 140 to $ 145 , excluding special items , in 2014 , a decrease of $ 5 to $ 10 from 2013 , resulting primarily from an increase in discount rates , partially offset by unfavorable impacts associated with changes in mortality and inflation assumptions . pension settlement losses of $ 10 to $ 25 are expected , dependent on the timing of retirements . in 2014 , pension expense will include approximately $ 118 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $ 143 in 2013 . net actuarial gains of $ 370.4 were recognized in 2013 , resulting primarily from an approximately 65 bp increase in the weighted average discount rate as well as actual asset returns above expected returns . actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses . future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets , different from expected returns , would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2014 . pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans , which are primarily non-qualified plans . with respect to funded plans , our funding policy is that contributions , combined with appreciation and earnings , will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses . in addition , we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions . with the assistance of third party actuaries , we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan , which help guide the level of contributions . during 2013 and 2012 , our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $ 300.8 and $ 76.4 , respectively . contributions for 2013 include voluntary contributions for u.s . plans of $ 220.0. .

increased by $ 105.6 million , or 3.4% ( 3.4 % ) , from 2006 to 2007 . the following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended december 31 , 2008 , 2007 and 2006: . ( 1 ) core volume growth for the year ended december 31 , 2006 includes .8% ( .8 % ) associated with hauling waste from the city of toronto to one of our landfills in michigan . this hauling service is provided to the city at a rate that approximates our cost . ( 2 ) includes the impact of the acquisition of allied in december 2008 . ( 3 ) represents new taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states that are passed on to customers . 25aa 2008 : during the year ended december 31 , 2008 , our core revenue growth continued to benefit from a broad-based pricing initiative . in addition , 14.7% ( 14.7 % ) of our revenue growth is due to our acquisition of allied in december 2008 . revenue growth also benefited from higher fuel surcharges and environmental fees . however , during 2008 we experienced lower prices for commodities . we also experienced a decrease in core volumes primarily due to lower commercial and industrial collection volumes and lower landfill volumes resulting from the slowdown in the economy . we expect to continue to experience lower volumes until economic conditions improve . 25aa 2007 : during the year ended december 31 , 2007 , our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from a broad-based pricing initiative . our revenue growth also benefited from higher prices for commodities . however , we experienced a decrease in core volume growth primarily due to lower industrial collection and landfill volumes resulting from the slowdown in residential construction . 25aa 2006 : during the year ended december 31 , 2006 , our revenue growth continued to benefit from our broad-based pricing initiative . we experienced core volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business . this core volume growth was partially offset by hurricane clean-up efforts that took place during the fourth quarter of 2005 . 25aa 2009 outlook : we anticipate internal revenue from core operations to decrease approximately 4.0% ( 4.0 % ) during 2009 . this decrease is the expected net of growth in core pricing of approximately 4.0% ( 4.0 % ) and an expected decrease in volume of approximately 8.0% ( 8.0 % ) . our projections assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2008 . however , our internal growth may remain flat or may decline in 2009 depending on economic conditions and our success in implementing pricing initiatives . cost of operations . cost of operations was $ 2.4 billion , $ 2.0 billion and $ 1.9 billion , or , as a percentage of revenue , 65.6% ( 65.6 % ) , 63.1% ( 63.1 % ) and 62.7% ( 62.7 % ) , for the years ended december 31 , 2008 , 2007 and 2006 , respectively . the increase in cost of operations in aggregate dollars for the year ended december 31 , 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily a result of our acquisition of allied in december 2008 . the remaining increase in cost of operations in aggregate dollars and the increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to charges we recorded during 2008 of $ 98.0 million related to estimated costs to comply with f&os issued by the oepa and the aoc issued by the epa in response to environmental conditions at our countywide facility in ohio , $ 21.9 million related to environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility %%transmsg*** transmitting job : p14076 pcn : 048000000 ***%%pcmsg|46 |00044|yes|no|02/28/2009 17:08|0|0|page is valid , no graphics -- color : d| .

the aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments . due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments , the discussion of the results of operations of those business segments focuses on lines of business within the segment rather than on specific programs . the following tables of financial information and related discussion of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in note 5 to the financial statements . we have a number of programs that are classified by the u.s . government and cannot be specifically described . the operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results , and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs . aeronautics our aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research , design , development , manufacture , integration , sustainment , support , and upgrade of advanced military aircraft , including combat and air mobility aircraft , unmanned air vehicles , and related technologies . key combat aircraft programs include the f-35 lightning ii , f-16 fighting falcon , and f-22 raptor fighter aircraft . key air mobility programs include the c-130j super hercules and the c-5m super galaxy . aeronautics provides logistics support , sustainment , and upgrade modification services for its aircraft . aeronautics 2019 operating results included the following : ( in millions ) 2010 2009 2008 . net sales for aeronautics increased by 8% ( 8 % ) in 2010 compared to 2009 . sales increased in all three lines of business during the year . the $ 800 million increase in air mobility primarily was attributable to higher volume on c-130 programs , including deliveries and support activities , as well as higher volume on the c-5 reliability enhancement and re-engining program ( rerp ) . there were 25 c-130j deliveries in 2010 compared to 16 in 2009 . the $ 179 million increase in combat aircraft principally was due to higher volume on f-35 production contracts , which partially was offset by lower volume on the f-35 sdd contract and a decline in volume on f-16 , f-22 and other combat aircraft programs . there were 20 f-16 deliveries in 2010 compared to 31 in 2009 . the $ 55 million increase in other aeronautics programs mainly was due to higher volume on p-3 and advanced development programs , which partially were offset by a decline in volume on sustainment activities . net sales for aeronautics increased by 6% ( 6 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 . during the year , sales increased in all three lines of business . the increase of $ 296 million in air mobility 2019s sales primarily was attributable to higher volume on the c-130 programs , including deliveries and support activities . there were 16 c-130j deliveries in 2009 and 12 in 2008 . combat aircraft sales increased $ 316 million principally due to higher volume on the f-35 program and increases in f-16 deliveries , which partially were offset by lower volume on f-22 and other combat aircraft programs . there were 31 f-16 deliveries in 2009 compared to 28 in 2008 . the $ 116 million increase in other aeronautics programs mainly was due to higher volume on p-3 programs and advanced development programs , which partially were offset by declines in sustainment activities . operating profit for the segment decreased by 5% ( 5 % ) in 2010 compared to 2009 . a decline in operating profit in combat aircraft partially was offset by increases in other aeronautics programs and air mobility . the $ 149 million decrease in combat aircraft 2019s operating profit primarily was due to lower volume and a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on the f-22 program , the f-35 sdd contract and f-16 and other combat aircraft programs in 2010 . these decreases more than offset increased operating profit resulting from higher volume and improved performance on f-35 production contracts in 2010 . the $ 35 million increase in other aeronautics programs mainly was attributable to higher volume and improved performance on p-3 and advanced development programs as well as an increase in the level of favorable performance adjustments on sustainment activities in 2010 . the $ 19 million increase in air mobility operating profit primarily was due to higher volume and improved performance in 2010 on c-130j support activities , which more than offset a decrease in operating profit due to a lower level of favorable performance adjustments on c-130j deliveries in 2010 . the remaining change in operating profit is attributable to an increase in other income , net between the comparable periods . aeronautics 2019 2010 operating margins have decreased when compared to 2009 . the operating margin decrease reflects the life cycles of our significant programs . specifically , aeronautics is performing more development and initial production work on the f-35 program and is performing less work on more mature programs such as the f-22 and f-16 . development and initial production contracts yield lower profits than mature full rate programs . accordingly , while net sales increased in 2010 relative to 2009 , operating profit decreased and consequently operating margins have declined. .

development of prior year incurred losses was $ 135.6 million unfavorable in 2006 , $ 26.4 million favorable in 2005 and $ 249.4 million unfavorable in 2004 . such losses were the result of the reserve development noted above , as well as inher- ent uncertainty in establishing loss and lae reserves . reserves for asbestos and environmental losses and loss adjustment expenses as of year end 2006 , 7.4% ( 7.4 % ) of reserves reflect an estimate for the company 2019s ultimate liability for a&e claims for which ulti- mate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques . the company 2019s a&e liabilities stem from mt . mckinley 2019s direct insurance business and everest re 2019s assumed reinsurance business . there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company 2019s potential losses from a&e claims . see item 7 , 201cmanagement 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 2014asbestos and environmental exposures 201d and note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements . mt . mckinley 2019s book of direct a&e exposed insurance is relatively small and homogenous . it also arises from a limited period , effective 1978 to 1984 . the book is based principally on excess liability policies , thereby limiting exposure analysis to a lim- ited number of policies and forms . as a result of this focused structure , the company believes that it is able to comprehen- sively analyze its exposures , allowing it to identify , analyze and actively monitor those claims which have unusual exposure , including policies in which it may be exposed to pay expenses in addition to policy limits or non-products asbestos claims . the company endeavors to be actively engaged with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to mt . mckinley . such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement , negotiation , litigation , or the monitoring of claim activity under settlement in place ( 201csip 201d ) agreements . sip agreements generally condition an insurer 2019s payment upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other measures to control the insurer 2019s payments . the company 2019s mt . mckinley operation is currently managing eight sip agreements , three of which were executed prior to the acquisition of mt . mckinley in 2000 . the company 2019s preference with respect to coverage settlements is to exe- cute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments , because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty . the company has significantly enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics over time , as well as its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active . those insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous , but still active management , with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics , which may indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity . the company continually focuses on further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential exposure of policyholders , including those that may not have reported significant a&e losses . everest re 2019s book of assumed reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a modest number of a&e exposed relationships . it also arises from a limited period , effectively 1977 to 1984 . because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the company has been managing the a&e exposures for many years , its claim staff is familiar with the ceding companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to generate future liabilities . the company 2019s claim staff has developed familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims handling and reserving practices of those companies . this level of familiarity enhances the quality of the company 2019s analysis of its exposure through those companies . as a result , the company believes that it can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure , such as non-products asbestos claims , for concentrated attention . however , in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities , the company relies on claims data supplied , both formally and informally by its ceding companies and brokers . this furnished information is not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeli- ness of the company 2019s ultimate loss projections . the following table summarizes the composition of the company 2019s total reserves for a&e losses , gross and net of reinsurance , for the years ended december 31: .

interest-earning assets including unearned income in the accretion of fair value adjustments on discounts recognized on acquired or purchased loans is recognized based on the constant effective yield of the financial instrument . the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in any period is dependent on estimates , judgments , assumptions , and interpretation of contractual terms . changes in these factors can have a significant impact on revenue recognized in any period due to changes in products , market conditions or industry norms . residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights we elect to measure our residential mortgage servicing rights ( msrs ) at fair value . this election was made to be consistent with our risk management strategy to hedge changes in the fair value of these assets as described below . the fair value of residential msrs is estimated by using a cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows , taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates , discount rates , servicing costs , and other economic factors which are determined based on current market conditions . assumptions incorporated into the residential msrs valuation model reflect management 2019s best estimate of factors that a market participant would use in valuing the residential msrs . although sales of residential msrs do occur , residential msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available . as a benchmark for the reasonableness of its residential msrs fair value , pnc obtains opinions of value from independent parties ( 201cbrokers 201d ) . these brokers provided a range ( +/- 10 bps ) based upon their own discounted cash flow calculations of our portfolio that reflected conditions in the secondary market , and any recently executed servicing transactions . pnc compares its internally-developed residential msrs value to the ranges of values received from the brokers . if our residential msrs fair value falls outside of the brokers 2019 ranges , management will assess whether a valuation adjustment is warranted . for 2011 and 2010 , pnc 2019s residential msrs value has not fallen outside of the brokers 2019 ranges . we consider our residential msrs value to represent a reasonable estimate of fair value . commercial msrs are purchased or originated when loans are sold with servicing retained . commercial msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available . commercial msrs are initially recorded at fair value and are subsequently accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value . commercial msrs are periodically evaluated for impairment . for purposes of impairment , the commercial mortgage servicing rights are stratified based on asset type , which characterizes the predominant risk of the underlying financial asset . the fair value of commercial msrs is estimated by using an internal valuation model . the model calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows considering estimates of servicing revenue and costs , discount rates and prepayment speeds . pnc employs risk management strategies designed to protect the value of msrs from changes in interest rates and related market factors . residential msrs values are economically hedged with securities and derivatives , including interest-rate swaps , options , and forward mortgage-backed and futures contracts . as interest rates change , these financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the hedged residential msrs portfolio . the hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the residential msrs assets . commercial msrs are economically hedged at a macro level or with specific derivatives to protect against a significant decline in interest rates . selecting appropriate financial instruments to economically hedge residential or commercial msrs requires significant management judgment to assess how mortgage rates and prepayment speeds could affect the future values of msrs . hedging results can frequently be less predictable in the short term , but over longer periods of time are expected to protect the economic value of the msrs . the fair value of residential and commercial msrs and significant inputs to the valuation model as of december 31 , 2011 are shown in the tables below . the expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value . management uses a third-party model to estimate future residential loan prepayments and internal proprietary models to estimate future commercial loan prepayments . these models have been refined based on current market conditions . future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of msrs . management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of

the analysis of our depreciation studies . changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively . under group depreciation , the historical cost ( net of salvage ) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized . the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using ( i ) inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ( ii ) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies . the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes . because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired , we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate . in addition , we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient ( or in excess ) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies . any deficiency ( or excess ) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets . for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business , a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions : ( i ) is unusual , ( ii ) is material in amount , and ( iii ) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies . a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations . when we purchase an asset , we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use . however , many of our assets are self-constructed . a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties , which is typically performed by our employees , and for track line expansion and other capacity projects . costs that are directly attributable to capital projects ( including overhead costs ) are capitalized . direct costs that are capitalized as part of self- constructed assets include material , labor , and work equipment . indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset . general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred . normal repairs and maintenance are also expensed as incurred , while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset , improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized . these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases . total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was $ 2.3 billion for 2013 , $ 2.1 billion for 2012 , and $ 2.2 billion for 2011 . assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease . amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease . 12 . accounts payable and other current liabilities dec . 31 , dec . 31 , millions 2013 2012 . .

when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable . the company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria . at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , the company had $ 219 million and $ 152 million , respectively , of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities/other liabilities of consolidated vies on the consolidated statements of financial condition . a portion of the deferred carried interest liability will be paid to certain employees . the ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue , if any , for these products is unknown . the following table presents changes in the deferred carried interest liability ( including the portion related to consolidated vies ) for 2017 and 2016: . for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , performance fee revenue ( which included recognized carried interest ) totaled $ 594 million , $ 295 million and $ 621 million , respectively . fees earned for technology and risk management revenue are recorded as services are performed and are generally determined using the value of positions on the aladdin platform or on a fixed-rate basis . for 2017 , 2016 and 2016 , technology and risk management revenue totaled $ 677 million , $ 595 million and $ 528 million , respectively . adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock 2019s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on aum and since the company does not record performance fee revenue until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable . accounting developments recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted . revenue from contracts with customers . in may 2014 , the financial accounting standards board ( 201cfasb 201d ) issued accounting standards update ( 201casu 201d ) 2014-09 , revenue from contracts with customers ( 201casu 2014-09 201d ) . asu 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance , including industry-specific guidance . the guidance also changes the accounting for certain contract costs and revises the criteria for determining if an entity is acting as a principal or agent in certain arrangements . the key changes in the standard that impact the company 2019s revenue recognition relate to the presentation of certain revenue contracts and associated contract costs . the most significant of these changes relates to the presentation of certain distribution costs , which are currently presented net against revenues ( contra-revenue ) and will be presented as an expense on a gross basis . the company adopted asu 2014-09 effective january 1 , 2018 on a full retrospective basis , which will require 2016 and 2017 to be restated in future filings . the cumulative effect adjustment to the 2016 opening retained earnings was not material . the company currently expects the net gross up to revenue to be approximately $ 1 billion with a corresponding gross up to expense for both 2016 and 2017 . consequently , the company expects its gaap operating margin to decline upon adoption due to the gross up of revenue . however , no material impact is expected on the company 2019s as adjusted operating margin . for accounting pronouncements that the company adopted during the year ended december 31 , 2017 and for additional recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted , see note 2 , significant accounting policies , in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii , item 8 of this filing . item 7a . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk aum market price risk . blackrock 2019s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and , in some cases , performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on aum . at december 31 , 2017 , the majority of the company 2019s investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end aum of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts . movements in equity market prices , interest rates/credit spreads , foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of aum to decline , which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees . corporate investments portfolio risks . as a leading investment management firm , blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying , measuring , monitoring , managing and analyzing market and operating risks , including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio . the board of directors of the company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the company , requiring , among other things , that investments be reviewed by certain senior officers of the company , and that certain investments may be referred to the audit committee or the board of directors , depending on the circumstances , for approval . in the normal course of its business , blackrock is exposed to equity market price risk , interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments . blackrock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes , including real assets , private equity and hedge funds . investments generally are made for co-investment purposes , to establish a performance track record , to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes . currently , the company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into swaps to hedge market and interest rate exposure to certain investments . at december 31 , 2017 , the company had outstanding total return swaps with an aggregate notional value of approximately $ 587 million . at december 31 , 2017 , there

for 2012 and 3.92% ( 3.92 % ) for 2011 . the increase in the comparison was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted-average rate accrued on total interest- bearing liabilities of 29 basis points , largely offset by a 21 basis point decrease on the yield on total interest-earning assets . the decrease in the rate on interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the runoff of maturing retail certificates of deposit and the redemption of additional trust preferred and hybrid capital securities during 2012 , in addition to an increase in fhlb borrowings and commercial paper as lower-cost funding sources . the decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets was primarily due to lower rates on new loan volume and lower yields on new securities in the current low rate environment . with respect to the first quarter of 2013 , we expect net interest income to decline by two to three percent compared to fourth quarter 2012 net interest income of $ 2.4 billion , due to a decrease in purchase accounting accretion of up to $ 50 to $ 60 million , including lower expected cash recoveries . for the full year 2013 , we expect net interest income to decrease compared with 2012 , assuming an expected decline in purchase accounting accretion of approximately $ 400 million , while core net interest income is expected to increase in the year-over-year comparison . we believe our net interest margin will come under pressure in 2013 , due to the expected decline in purchase accounting accretion and assuming that the current low rate environment continues . noninterest income noninterest income totaled $ 5.9 billion for 2012 and $ 5.6 billion for 2011 . the overall increase in the comparison was primarily due to an increase in residential mortgage loan sales revenue driven by higher loan origination volume , gains on sales of visa class b common shares and higher corporate service fees , largely offset by higher provision for residential mortgage repurchase obligations . asset management revenue , including blackrock , totaled $ 1.2 billion in 2012 compared with $ 1.1 billion in 2011 . this increase was primarily due to higher earnings from our blackrock investment . discretionary assets under management increased to $ 112 billion at december 31 , 2012 compared with $ 107 billion at december 31 , 2011 driven by stronger average equity markets , positive net flows and strong sales performance . for 2012 , consumer services fees were $ 1.1 billion compared with $ 1.2 billion in 2011 . the decline reflected the regulatory impact of lower interchange fees on debit card transactions partially offset by customer growth . as further discussed in the retail banking portion of the business segments review section of this item 7 , the dodd-frank limits on interchange rates were effective october 1 , 2011 and had a negative impact on revenue of approximately $ 314 million in 2012 and $ 75 million in 2011 . this impact was partially offset by higher volumes of merchant , customer credit card and debit card transactions and the impact of the rbc bank ( usa ) acquisition . corporate services revenue increased by $ .3 billion , or 30 percent , to $ 1.2 billion in 2012 compared with $ .9 billion in 2011 due to higher commercial mortgage servicing revenue and higher merger and acquisition advisory fees in 2012 . the major components of corporate services revenue are treasury management revenue , corporate finance fees , including revenue from capital markets-related products and services , and commercial mortgage servicing revenue , including commercial mortgage banking activities . see the product revenue portion of this consolidated income statement review for further detail . the pnc financial services group , inc . 2013 form 10-k 39 .

discount rate 2014the assumed discount rate is used to determine the current retirement related benefit plan expense and obligations , and represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to effectively settle a plan 2019s benefit obligations . the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate . benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan , but also on the underlying participant demographics , including current age , and assumed mortality . we use only bonds that are denominated in u.s . dollars , rated aa or better by two of three nationally recognized statistical rating agencies , have a minimum outstanding issue of $ 50 million as of the measurement date , and are not callable , convertible , or index linked . since bond yields are generally unavailable beyond 30 years , we assume those rates will remain constant beyond that point . taking into consideration the factors noted above , our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 5.23% ( 5.23 % ) and 5.84% ( 5.84 % ) , as of december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 4.94% ( 4.94 % ) and 5.58% ( 5.58 % ) as of december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . expected long-term rate of return 2014the expected long-term rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense , and is based on such factors as historical returns , targeted asset allocations , investment policy , duration , expected future long-term performance of individual asset classes , inflation trends , portfolio volatility , and risk management strategies . while studies are helpful in understanding current trends and performance , the assumption is based more on longer term and prospective views . in order to reflect expected lower future market returns , we have reduced the expected long-term rate of return assumption from 8.50% ( 8.50 % ) , used to record 2011 expense , to 8.00% ( 8.00 % ) for 2012 . the decrease in the expected return on assets assumption is primarily related to lower bond yields and updated return assumptions for equities . unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year , the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year . an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions : ( $ in millions ) increase ( decrease ) in 2012 expense increase ( decrease ) in december 31 , 2011 obligations . differences arising from actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect retirement related benefit plan obligations and the funded status . actuarial gains and losses arising from differences from actual experience or changes in assumptions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income . this unrecognized amount is amortized to the extent it exceeds 10% ( 10 % ) of the greater of the plan 2019s benefit obligation or plan assets . the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses is the estimated average remaining service life of the plan participants , which is approximately 10 years . cas expense 2014in addition to providing the methodology for calculating retirement related benefit plan costs , cas also prescribes the method for assigning those costs to specific periods . while the ultimate liability for such costs under fas and cas is similar , the pattern of cost recognition is different . the key drivers of cas pension expense include the funded status and the method used to calculate cas reimbursement for each of our plans as well as our expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption . unlike fas , cas requires the discount rate to be consistent with the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption , which changes infrequently given its long-term nature . as a result , changes in bond or other interest rates generally do not impact cas . in addition , unlike under fas , we can only allocate pension costs for a plan under cas until such plan is fully funded as determined under erisa requirements . other fas and cas considerations 2014we update our estimates of future fas and cas costs at least annually based on factors such as calendar year actual plan asset returns , final census data from the end of the prior year , and other actual and projected experience . a key driver of the difference between fas and cas expense ( and consequently , the fas/cas adjustment ) is the pattern of earnings and expense recognition for gains and losses that arise when our asset and liability experiences differ from our assumptions under each set of requirements . under fas , our net gains and losses exceeding the 10% ( 10 % ) corridor are amortized .

( 2 ) our total leasing activity increased and we also increased wholly owned development activities from 2010 . we capitalized $ 25.3 million and $ 10.4 million of our total overhead costs to leasing and development , respectively , for consolidated properties during 2011 , compared to capitalizing $ 23.5 million and $ 8.5 million of such costs , respectively , for 2010 . combined overhead costs capitalized to leasing and development totaled 20.6% ( 20.6 % ) and 19.1% ( 19.1 % ) of our overall pool of overhead costs for 2011 and 2010 , respectively. .

when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable . the company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria . at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , the company had $ 219 million and $ 152 million , respectively , of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities/other liabilities of consolidated vies on the consolidated statements of financial condition . a portion of the deferred carried interest liability will be paid to certain employees . the ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue , if any , for these products is unknown . the following table presents changes in the deferred carried interest liability ( including the portion related to consolidated vies ) for 2017 and 2016: . for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , performance fee revenue ( which included recognized carried interest ) totaled $ 594 million , $ 295 million and $ 621 million , respectively . fees earned for technology and risk management revenue are recorded as services are performed and are generally determined using the value of positions on the aladdin platform or on a fixed-rate basis . for 2017 , 2016 and 2016 , technology and risk management revenue totaled $ 677 million , $ 595 million and $ 528 million , respectively . adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock 2019s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on aum and since the company does not record performance fee revenue until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable . accounting developments recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted . revenue from contracts with customers . in may 2014 , the financial accounting standards board ( 201cfasb 201d ) issued accounting standards update ( 201casu 201d ) 2014-09 , revenue from contracts with customers ( 201casu 2014-09 201d ) . asu 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance , including industry-specific guidance . the guidance also changes the accounting for certain contract costs and revises the criteria for determining if an entity is acting as a principal or agent in certain arrangements . the key changes in the standard that impact the company 2019s revenue recognition relate to the presentation of certain revenue contracts and associated contract costs . the most significant of these changes relates to the presentation of certain distribution costs , which are currently presented net against revenues ( contra-revenue ) and will be presented as an expense on a gross basis . the company adopted asu 2014-09 effective january 1 , 2018 on a full retrospective basis , which will require 2016 and 2017 to be restated in future filings . the cumulative effect adjustment to the 2016 opening retained earnings was not material . the company currently expects the net gross up to revenue to be approximately $ 1 billion with a corresponding gross up to expense for both 2016 and 2017 . consequently , the company expects its gaap operating margin to decline upon adoption due to the gross up of revenue . however , no material impact is expected on the company 2019s as adjusted operating margin . for accounting pronouncements that the company adopted during the year ended december 31 , 2017 and for additional recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted , see note 2 , significant accounting policies , in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii , item 8 of this filing . item 7a . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk aum market price risk . blackrock 2019s investment advisory and administration fees are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and , in some cases , performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns realized on aum . at december 31 , 2017 , the majority of the company 2019s investment advisory and administration fees were based on average or period end aum of the applicable investment funds or separate accounts . movements in equity market prices , interest rates/credit spreads , foreign exchange rates or all three could cause the value of aum to decline , which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees . corporate investments portfolio risks . as a leading investment management firm , blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identifying , measuring , monitoring , managing and analyzing market and operating risks , including the management and oversight of its own investment portfolio . the board of directors of the company has adopted guidelines for the review of investments to be made by the company , requiring , among other things , that investments be reviewed by certain senior officers of the company , and that certain investments may be referred to the audit committee or the board of directors , depending on the circumstances , for approval . in the normal course of its business , blackrock is exposed to equity market price risk , interest rate/credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate risk associated with its corporate investments . blackrock has investments primarily in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes , including real assets , private equity and hedge funds . investments generally are made for co-investment purposes , to establish a performance track record , to hedge exposure to certain deferred compensation plans or for regulatory purposes . currently , the company has a seed capital hedging program in which it enters into swaps to hedge market and interest rate exposure to certain investments . at december 31 , 2017 , the company had outstanding total return swaps with an aggregate notional value of approximately $ 587 million . at december 31 , 2017 , there were no outstanding interest rate swaps. .

"Single_WRK/2019/page_135.pdf-1","what was the weighted average total of the aggregate cost of the per share repurchased from 2017 to 2019","51.6","$51.61 per share","<LOGIC>
Step 1: Identify the number of shares repurchased and the aggregate cost for each year.
- In 2017, 1.8 million shares were repurchased for $93.0 million.
- In 2018, 3.4 million shares were repurchased for $195.1 million.
- In 2019, 2.1 million shares were repurchased for $88.6 million.

Step 2: Calculate the weighted average cost per share for each year.
- For 2017, the cost per share is $93.0 million / 1.8 million shares = $51.67 per share.
- For 2018, the cost per share is $195.1 million / 3.4 million shares = $57.38 per share.
- For 2019, the cost per share is $88.6 million / 2.1 million shares = $42.19 per share.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of shares repurchased over the three years, which is 1.8 million + 3.4 million + 2.1 million = 7.3 million shares.

Step 4: Calculate the total aggregate cost over the three years, which is $93.0 million + $195.1 million + $88.6 million = $376.7 million.

Step 5: Calculate the weighted average total of the aggregate cost per share repurchased from 2017 to 2019, which is $376.7 million / 7.3 million shares = $51.61 per share.

( 1 ) amount in fiscal 2015 represents changes to goodwill as a result of finalizing the acquisition accounting related to the hittite acquisition . ( 2 ) represents goodwill related to other acquisitions that were not material to the company on either an individual or aggregate basis . intangible assets the company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable . recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining .

the company endeavors to actively engage with every insured account posing significant potential asbestos exposure to mt . mckinley . such engagement can take the form of pursuing a final settlement , negotiation , litigation , or the monitoring of claim activity under settlement in place ( 201csip 201d ) agreements . sip agreements generally condition an insurer 2019s payment upon the actual claim experience of the insured and may have annual payment caps or other measures to control the insurer 2019s payments . the company 2019s mt . mckinley operation is currently managing four sip agreements , one of which was executed prior to the acquisition of mt . mckinley in 2000 . the company 2019s preference with respect to coverage settlements is to execute settlements that call for a fixed schedule of payments , because such settlements eliminate future uncertainty . the company has significantly enhanced its classification of insureds by exposure characteristics over time , as well as its analysis by insured for those it considers to be more exposed or active . those insureds identified as relatively less exposed or active are subject to less rigorous , but still active management , with an emphasis on monitoring those characteristics , which may indicate an increasing exposure or levels of activity . the company continually focuses on further enhancement of the detailed estimation processes used to evaluate potential exposure of policyholders . everest re 2019s book of assumed a&e reinsurance is relatively concentrated within a limited number of contracts and for a limited period , from 1974 to 1984 . because the book of business is relatively concentrated and the company has been managing the a&e exposures for many years , its claim staff is familiar with the ceding companies that have generated most of these liabilities in the past and which are therefore most likely to generate future liabilities . the company 2019s claim staff has developed familiarity both with the nature of the business written by its ceding companies and the claims handling and reserving practices of those companies . this level of familiarity enhances the quality of the company 2019s analysis of its exposure through those companies . as a result , the company believes that it can identify those claims on which it has unusual exposure , such as non-products asbestos claims , for concentrated attention . however , in setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities , the company relies on claims data supplied , both formally and informally by its ceding companies and brokers . this furnished information is not always timely or accurate and can impact the accuracy and timeliness of the company 2019s ultimate loss projections . the following table summarizes the composition of the company 2019s total reserves for a&e losses , gross and net of reinsurance , for the periods indicated: . ( 1 ) additional reserves are case specific reserves established by the company in excess of those reported by the ceding company , based on the company 2019s assessment of the covered loss . ( some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding. ) additional losses , including those relating to latent injuries and other exposures , which are as yet unrecognized , the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by either the company or the industry , may emerge in the future . such future emergence could have material adverse effects on the company 2019s future financial condition , results of operations and cash flows. .

( a ) the weighted-average remaining contractual life was approximately 4.2 years . at december 31 , 2007 , there were approximately 13788000 options in total that were vested and are expected to vest . the weighted-average exercise price of such options was $ 62.07 per share , the weighted-average remaining contractual life was approximately 5.2 years , and the aggregate intrinsic value at december 31 , 2007 was approximately $ 92 million . stock options granted in 2005 include options for 30000 shares that were granted to non-employee directors that year . no such options were granted in 2006 or 2007 . awards granted to non-employee directors in 2007 include 20944 deferred stock units awarded under the outside directors deferred stock unit plan . a deferred stock unit is a phantom share of our common stock , which requires liability accounting treatment under sfas 123r until such awards are paid to the participants as cash . as there are no vestings or service requirements on these awards , total compensation expense is recognized in full on all awarded units on the date of grant . the weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted in 2007 , 2006 and 2005 was $ 11.37 , $ 10.75 and $ 9.83 per option , respectively . to determine stock-based compensation expense under sfas 123r , the grant-date fair value is applied to the options granted with a reduction made for estimated forfeitures . at december 31 , 2006 and 2005 options for 10743000 and 13582000 shares of common stock , respectively , were exercisable at a weighted-average price of $ 58.38 and $ 56.58 , respectively . the total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2007 , 2006 and 2005 was $ 52 million , $ 111 million and $ 31 million , respectively . at december 31 , 2007 the aggregate intrinsic value of all options outstanding and exercisable was $ 94 million and $ 87 million , respectively . cash received from option exercises under all incentive plans for 2007 , 2006 and 2005 was approximately $ 111 million , $ 233 million and $ 98 million , respectively . the actual tax benefit realized for tax deduction purposes from option exercises under all incentive plans for 2007 , 2006 and 2005 was approximately $ 39 million , $ 82 million and $ 34 million , respectively . there were no options granted in excess of market value in 2007 , 2006 or 2005 . shares of common stock available during the next year for the granting of options and other awards under the incentive plans were 40116726 at december 31 , 2007 . total shares of pnc common stock authorized for future issuance under equity compensation plans totaled 41787400 shares at december 31 , 2007 , which includes shares available for issuance under the incentive plans , the employee stock purchase plan as described below , and a director plan . during 2007 , we issued approximately 2.1 million shares from treasury stock in connection with stock option exercise activity . as with past exercise activity , we intend to utilize treasury stock for future stock option exercises . as discussed in note 1 accounting policies , we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123 prospectively to all employee awards including stock options granted , modified or settled after january 1 , 2003 . as permitted under sfas 123 , we recognized compensation expense for stock options on a straight-line basis over the pro rata vesting period . total compensation expense recognized related to pnc stock options in 2007 was $ 29 million compared with $ 31 million in 2006 and $ 29 million in 2005 . pro forma effects a table is included in note 1 accounting policies that sets forth pro forma net income and basic and diluted earnings per share as if compensation expense had been recognized under sfas 123 and 123r , as amended , for stock options for 2005 . for purposes of computing stock option expense and 2005 pro forma results , we estimated the fair value of stock options using the black-scholes option pricing model . the model requires the use of numerous assumptions , many of which are very subjective . therefore , the 2005 pro forma results are estimates of results of operations as if compensation expense had been recognized for all stock-based compensation awards and are not indicative of the impact on future periods. .

to determine stock-based compensation expense , the grant- date fair value is applied to the options granted with a reduction for estimated forfeitures . we recognize compensation expense for stock options on a straight-line basis over the pro rata vesting period . at december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , options for 12337000 and 13397000 shares of common stock were exercisable at a weighted-average price of $ 106.08 and $ 118.21 , respectively . the total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $ 37 million , $ 4 million and $ 5 million . cash received from option exercises under all incentive plans for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was approximately $ 118 million , $ 41 million and $ 15 million , respectively . the actual tax benefit realized for tax deduction purposes from option exercises under all incentive plans for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was approximately $ 41 million , $ 14 million and $ 5 million , respectively . there were no options granted in excess of market value in 2012 , 2011 or 2010 . shares of common stock available during the next year for the granting of options and other awards under the incentive plans were 29192854 at december 31 , 2012 . total shares of pnc common stock authorized for future issuance under equity compensation plans totaled 30537674 shares at december 31 , 2012 , which includes shares available for issuance under the incentive plans and the employee stock purchase plan ( espp ) as described below . during 2012 , we issued approximately 1.7 million shares from treasury stock in connection with stock option exercise activity . as with past exercise activity , we currently intend to utilize primarily treasury stock for any future stock option exercises . awards granted to non-employee directors in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 include 25620 , 27090 and 29040 deferred stock units , respectively , awarded under the outside directors deferred stock unit plan . a deferred stock unit is a phantom share of our common stock , which requires liability accounting treatment until such awards are paid to the participants as cash . as there are no vesting or service requirements on these awards , total compensation expense is recognized in full on awarded deferred stock units on the date of grant . incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards the fair value of nonvested incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards is initially determined based on prices not less than the market value of our common stock price on the date of grant . the value of certain incentive/ performance unit share awards is subsequently remeasured based on the achievement of one or more financial and other performance goals generally over a three-year period . the personnel and compensation committee of the board of directors approves the final award payout with respect to incentive/performance unit share awards . restricted stock/unit awards have various vesting periods generally ranging from 36 months to 60 months . beginning in 2012 , we incorporated several risk-related performance changes to certain incentive compensation programs . in addition to achieving certain financial performance metrics relative to our peers , the final payout amount will be subject to a negative adjustment if pnc fails to meet certain risk-related performance metrics as specified in the award agreement . however , the p&cc has the discretion to reduce any or all of this negative adjustment under certain circumstances . these awards have a three-year performance period and are payable in either stock or a combination of stock and cash . additionally , performance-based restricted share units were granted in 2012 to certain of our executives in lieu of stock options , with generally the same terms and conditions as the 2011 awards of the same . the weighted-average grant-date fair value of incentive/ performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards granted in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $ 60.68 , $ 63.25 and $ 54.59 per share , respectively . we recognize compensation expense for such awards ratably over the corresponding vesting and/or performance periods for each type of program . table 130 : nonvested incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards 2013 rollforward shares in thousands nonvested incentive/ performance unit shares weighted- average date fair nonvested restricted stock/ shares weighted- average date fair . in the chart above , the unit shares and related weighted- average grant-date fair value of the incentive/performance awards exclude the effect of dividends on the underlying shares , as those dividends will be paid in cash . at december 31 , 2012 , there was $ 86 million of unrecognized deferred compensation expense related to nonvested share- based compensation arrangements granted under the incentive plans . this cost is expected to be recognized as expense over a period of no longer than five years . the total fair value of incentive/performance unit share and restricted stock/unit awards vested during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was approximately $ 55 million , $ 52 million and $ 39 million , respectively . the pnc financial services group , inc . 2013 form 10-k 203 .

. * amounts presented are for electricity supplied by utility and merchant generation operations . operating results 2014 2002 dominion energy contributed $ 2.72 per diluted share on net income of $ 770 million for 2002 , a net income increase of $ 47 million and an earnings per share decrease of $ 0.14 over 2001 . net income for 2002 reflected lower operating revenue ( $ 204 million ) , operating expenses ( $ 229 million ) and other income ( $ 27 million ) . interest expense and income taxes , which are discussed on a consolidated basis , decreased $ 50 million over 2001 . the earnings per share decrease reflected share dilution . regulated electric sales revenue increased $ 179 million . favorable weather conditions , reflecting increased cooling and heating degree-days , as well as customer growth , are estimated to have contributed $ 133 million and $ 41 million , respectively . fuel rate recoveries increased approximately $ 65 million for 2002 . these recoveries are generally offset by increases in elec- tric fuel expense and do not materially affect income . partially offsetting these increases was a net decrease of $ 60 million due to other factors not separately measurable , such as the impact of economic conditions on customer usage , as well as variations in seasonal rate premiums and discounts . nonregulated electric sales revenue increased $ 9 million . sales revenue from dominion 2019s merchant generation fleet decreased $ 21 million , reflecting a $ 201 million decline due to lower prices partially offset by sales from assets acquired and constructed in 2002 and the inclusion of millstone operations for all of 2002 . revenue from the wholesale marketing of utility generation decreased $ 74 million . due to the higher demand of utility service territory customers during 2002 , less production from utility plant generation was available for profitable sale in the wholesale market . revenue from retail energy sales increased $ 71 million , reflecting primarily customer growth over the prior year . net revenue from dominion 2019s electric trading activities increased $ 33 million , reflecting the effect of favorable price changes on unsettled contracts and higher trading margins . nonregulated gas sales revenue decreased $ 351 million . the decrease included a $ 239 million decrease in sales by dominion 2019s field services and retail energy marketing opera- tions , reflecting to a large extent declining prices . revenue associated with gas trading operations , net of related cost of sales , decreased $ 112 million . the decrease included $ 70 mil- lion of realized and unrealized losses on the economic hedges of natural gas production by the dominion exploration & pro- duction segment . as described below under selected information 2014 energy trading activities , sales of natural gas by the dominion exploration & production segment at market prices offset these financial losses , resulting in a range of prices contemplated by dominion 2019s overall risk management strategy . the remaining $ 42 million decrease was due to unfavorable price changes on unsettled contracts and lower overall trading margins . those losses were partially offset by contributions from higher trading volumes in gas and oil markets . gas transportation and storage revenue decreased $ 44 million , primarily reflecting lower rates . electric fuel and energy purchases expense increased $ 94 million which included an increase of $ 66 million associated with dominion 2019s energy marketing operations that are not sub- ject to cost-based rate regulation and an increase of $ 28 million associated with utility operations . substantially all of the increase associated with non-regulated energy marketing opera- tions related to higher volumes purchased during the year . for utility operations , energy costs increased $ 66 million for pur- chases subject to rate recovery , partially offset by a $ 38 million decrease in fuel expenses associated with lower wholesale mar- keting of utility plant generation . purchased gas expense decreased $ 245 million associated with dominion 2019s field services and retail energy marketing oper- ations . this decrease reflected approximately $ 162 million asso- ciated with declining prices and $ 83 million associated with lower purchased volumes . liquids , pipeline capacity and other purchases decreased $ 64 million , primarily reflecting comparably lower levels of rate recoveries of certain costs of transmission operations in the cur- rent year period . the difference between actual expenses and amounts recovered in the period are deferred pending future rate adjustments . other operations and maintenance expense decreased $ 14 million , primarily reflecting an $ 18 million decrease in outage costs due to fewer generation unit outages in the current year . depreciation expense decreased $ 11 million , reflecting decreases in depreciation associated with changes in the esti- mated useful lives of certain electric generation property , par- tially offset by increased depreciation associated with state line and millstone operations .

for marketing . there are several methods that can be used to determine the estimated fair value of the ipr&d acquired in a business combination . we utilized the 201cincome method , 201d which applies a probability weighting to the estimated future net cash fl ows that are derived from projected sales revenues and estimated costs . these projec- tions are based on factors such as relevant market size , patent protection , historical pricing of similar products , and expected industry trends . the estimated future net cash fl ows are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate . this analysis is performed for each project independently . in accordance with fin 4 , applicability of fasb statement no . 2 to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method , these acquired ipr&d intangible assets totaling $ 4.71 billion and $ 340.5 million in 2008 and 2007 , respectively , were expensed immediately subsequent to the acquisition because the products had no alternative future use . the ongoing activities with respect to each of these products in development are not material to our research and development expenses . in addition to the acquisitions of businesses , we also acquired several products in development . the acquired ipr&d related to these products of $ 122.0 million and $ 405.1 million in 2008 and 2007 , respectively , was also writ- ten off by a charge to income immediately upon acquisition because the products had no alternative future use . imclone acquisition on november 24 , 2008 , we acquired all of the outstanding shares of imclone systems inc .

( a ) represents depreciation and amortization , gains and losses on derivative and foreign exchange transactions , deferred income taxes , provisions for uncollectible accounts , pension and postretirement benefit expense , stock compensation expense , impairment charges and other non-cash items . cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the 2010 to 2012 time period . operating cash flow was favorably impacted in 2012 , compared with 2011 , by lower contributions into our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans ; however , this was partially offset by changes in our working capital position , which was impacted by overall growth in the business . the change in the cash flows for income tax receivables and payables in 2011 and 2010 was primarily related to the timing of discretionary pension contributions during 2010 , as discussed further in the following paragraph . except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans , contributions to our company-sponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans . 2022 in 2012 , we made a $ 355 million required contribution to the ups ibt pension plan . 2022 in 2011 , we made a $ 1.2 billion contribution to the ups ibt pension plan , which satisfied our 2011 contribution requirements and also approximately $ 440 million in contributions that would not have been required until after 2011 . 2022 in 2010 , we made $ 2.0 billion in discretionary contributions to our ups retirement and ups pension plans , and $ 980 million in required contributions to our ups ibt pension plan . 2022 the remaining contributions in the 2010 through 2012 period were largely due to contributions to our international pension plans and u.s . postretirement medical benefit plans . as discussed further in the 201ccontractual commitments 201d section , we have minimum funding requirements in the next several years , primarily related to the ups ibt pension , ups retirement and ups pension plans . as of december 31 , 2012 , the total of our worldwide holdings of cash and cash equivalents was $ 7.327 billion . approximately $ 4.211 billion of this amount was held in european subsidiaries with the intended purpose of completing the acquisition of tnt express n.v . ( see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements ) . excluding this portion of cash held outside the u.s . for acquisition-related purposes , approximately 50%-60% ( 50%-60 % ) of the remaining cash and cash equivalents are held by foreign subsidiaries throughout the year . the amount of cash held by our u.s . and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors , including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business . cash provided by operating activities in the united states continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs , capital expenditures , share repurchases and dividend payments to shareowners . to the extent that such amounts represent previously untaxed earnings , the cash held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to tax if such amounts were repatriated in the form of dividends ; however , not all international cash balances would have to be repatriated in the form of a dividend if returned to the u.s . when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested , no accrual for taxes is provided. .

the income approach indicates value for an asset or liability based on the present value of cash flow projected to be generated over the remaining economic life of the asset or liability being measured . both the amount and the duration of the cash flows are considered from a market participant perspective . our estimates of market participant net cash flows considered historical and projected pricing , remaining developmental effort , operational performance including company- specific synergies , aftermarket retention , product life cycles , material and labor pricing , and other relevant customer , contractual and market factors . where appropriate , the net cash flows are adjusted to reflect the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions , as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation . the adjusted future cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate . projected cash flow is discounted at a required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money . the market approach is a valuation technique that uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets , liabilities , or a group of assets and liabilities . valuation techniques consistent with the market approach often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables . the cost approach , which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility , was used , as appropriate , for property , plant and equipment . the cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost , less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation . the purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of $ 2.8 billion of goodwill , all of which is expected to be amortizable for tax purposes . substantially all of the goodwill was assigned to our rms business . the goodwill recognized is attributable to expected revenue synergies generated by the integration of our products and technologies with those of sikorsky , costs synergies resulting from the consolidation or elimination of certain functions , and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition , such as the assembled workforce of sikorsky . determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the exercise of significant judgments , including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows , long-term growth rates and discount rates . the cash flows employed in the dcf analyses are based on our best estimate of future sales , earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions , customer budgets , existing firm orders , expected future orders , contracts with suppliers , labor agreements , changes in working capital , long term business plans and recent operating performance . use of different estimates and judgments could yield different results . impact to 2015 financial results sikorsky 2019s 2015 financial results have been included in our consolidated financial results only for the period from the november 6 , 2015 acquisition date through december 31 , 2015 . as a result , our consolidated financial results for the year ended december 31 , 2015 do not reflect a full year of sikorsky 2019s results . from the november 6 , 2015 acquisition date through december 31 , 2015 , sikorsky generated net sales of approximately $ 400 million and operating loss of approximately $ 45 million , inclusive of intangible amortization and adjustments required to account for the acquisition . we incurred approximately $ 38 million of non-recoverable transaction costs associated with the sikorsky acquisition in 2015 that were expensed as incurred . these costs are included in other income , net on our consolidated statements of earnings . we also incurred approximately $ 48 million in costs associated with issuing the $ 7.0 billion november 2015 notes used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the 364-day facility used to finance the acquisition . the financing costs were recorded as a reduction of debt and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt . supplemental pro forma financial information ( unaudited ) the following table presents summarized unaudited pro forma financial information as if sikorsky had been included in our financial results for the entire years in 2015 and 2014 ( in millions ) : . the unaudited supplemental pro forma financial data above has been calculated after applying our accounting policies and adjusting the historical results of sikorsky

long-term product offerings include active and index strategies . our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile . we offer two types of active strategies : those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction . in contrast , index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index , generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index . index strategies include both our non-etf index products and ishares etfs . although many clients use both active and index strategies , the application of these strategies may differ . for example , clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class , or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns . in addition , institutional non-etf index assignments tend to be very large ( multi-billion dollars ) and typically reflect low fee rates . this has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on blackrock 2019s revenues and earnings . equity year-end 2016 equity aum totaled $ 2.657 trillion , reflecting net inflows of $ 51.4 billion . net inflows included $ 74.9 billion into ishares , driven by net inflows into the core ranges and broad developed and emerging market equities . ishares net inflows were partially offset by active and non-etf index net outflows of $ 20.2 billion and $ 3.3 billion , respectively . blackrock 2019s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aum mix . approximately half of blackrock 2019s equity aum is tied to international markets , including emerging markets , which tend to have higher fee rates than u.s . equity strategies . accordingly , fluctuations in international equity markets , which may not consistently move in tandem with u.s . markets , have a greater impact on blackrock 2019s effective equity fee rates and revenues . fixed income fixed income aum ended 2016 at $ 1.572 trillion , reflecting net inflows of $ 120.0 billion . in 2016 , active net inflows of $ 16.6 billion were diversified across fixed income offerings , and included strong inflows from insurance clients . fixed income ishares net inflows of $ 59.9 billion were led by flows into the core ranges , emerging market , high yield and corporate bond funds . non-etf index net inflows of $ 43.4 billion were driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions . multi-asset blackrock 2019s multi-asset team manages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities , bonds , currencies and commodities , and our extensive risk management capabilities . investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays . component changes in multi-asset aum for 2016 are presented below . ( in millions ) december 31 , net inflows ( outflows ) market change impact december 31 . ( 1 ) the futureadvisor amount does not include aum that was held in ishares holdings . multi-asset net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $ 13.2 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients . defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows , and contributed $ 11.3 billion to institutional multi-asset net inflows in 2016 , primarily into target date and target risk product offerings . retail net outflows of $ 9.4 billion were primarily due to outflows from world allocation strategies . the company 2019s multi-asset strategies include the following : 2022 asset allocation and balanced products represented 45% ( 45 % ) of multi-asset aum at year-end . these strategies combine equity , fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget . in certain cases , these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification , derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions . flagship products in this category include our global allocation and multi-asset income fund families . 2022 target date and target risk products grew 11% ( 11 % ) organically in 2016 , with net inflows of $ 13.5 billion . institutional investors represented 94% ( 94 % ) of target date and target risk aum , with defined contribution plans accounting for 88% ( 88 % ) of aum . flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our lifepath and lifepath retirement income ae offerings . lifepath products utilize a proprietary asset allocation model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor 2019s expected retirement timing . 2022 fiduciary management services are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain blackrock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of plan management . these customized services require strong partnership with the clients 2019 investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives. .

straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of ten to forty years for buildings and improvements and three to eight years for machinery and equipment . maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred . we review property , plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable . an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset are less than its carrying amount . an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value . software costs 2013 we capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for

| Cash conversion cycle | 21 | 21 | 23 |

table of contents ( 4 ) the decline in cash flows was driven by the timing of inventory purchases at the end of 2014 versus 2013 . in order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs , we monitor our cash conversion cycle , defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable , based on a rolling three-month average . components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows: . ( 1 ) represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of trade accounts receivable , net at the end of the period divided by average daily net sales for the same three-month period . also incorporates components of other miscellaneous receivables . ( 2 ) represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of merchandise inventory at the end of the period divided by average daily cost of goods sold for the same three-month period . ( 3 ) represents the rolling three-month average of the combined balance of accounts payable-trade , excluding cash overdrafts , and accounts payable-inventory financing at the end of the period divided by average daily cost of goods sold for the same three-month period . the cash conversion cycle remained at 21 days at december 31 , 2015 and december 31 , 2014 . the increase in dso was primarily driven by a higher accounts receivable balance at december 31 , 2015 driven by higher public segment sales where customers generally take longer to pay than customers in our corporate segment , slower government payments in certain states due to budget issues and an increase in net sales and related accounts receivable for third-party services such as software assurance and warranties . these services have an unfavorable impact on dso as the receivable is recognized on the balance sheet on a gross basis while the corresponding sales amount in the statement of operations is recorded on a net basis . these services have a favorable impact on dpo as the payable is recognized on the balance sheet without a corresponding cost of sale in the statement of operations because the cost paid to the vendor or third-party service provider is recorded as a reduction to net sales . in addition to the impact of these services on dpo , dpo also increased due to the mix of payables with certain vendors that have longer payment terms . the cash conversion cycle decreased to 21 days at december 31 , 2014 compared to 23 days at december 31 , 2013 , primarily driven by improvement in dso . the decline in dso was primarily driven by improved collections and early payments from certain customers . additionally , the timing of inventory receipts at the end of 2014 had a favorable impact on dio and an unfavorable impact on dpo . investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased $ 189.6 million in 2015 compared to 2014 . the increase was primarily due to the completion of the acquisition of kelway by purchasing the remaining 65% ( 65 % ) of its outstanding common stock on august 1 , 2015 . additionally , capital expenditures increased $ 35.1 million to $ 90.1 million from $ 55.0 million for 2015 and 2014 , respectively , primarily for our new office location and an increase in spending related to improvements to our information technology systems . net cash used in investing activities increased $ 117.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013 . we paid $ 86.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to acquire a 35% ( 35 % ) non-controlling interest in kelway . additionally , capital expenditures increased $ 7.9 million to $ 55.0 million from $ 47.1 million in 2014 and 2013 , respectively , primarily for improvements to our information technology systems during both years . financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased $ 114.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014 . the increase was primarily driven by share repurchases during the year ended december 31 , 2015 which resulted in an increase in cash used for financing activities of $ 241.3 million . for more information on our share repurchase program , see item 5 , 201cmarket for registrant 2019s common equity , related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities . 201d the increase was partially offset by the changes in accounts payable-inventory financing , which resulted in an increase in cash provided for financing activities of $ 20.4 million , and the net impact of our debt transactions which resulted in cash outflows of $ 7.1 million and $ 145.9 million during the years .

we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve , which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value , based on various product sales projections . this reserve is calcu- lated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age , historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales . in addition , and as necessary , we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events . pension and other post-retirement benefit costs we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees : a domestic trust-based noncontributory qual- ified defined benefit pension plan ( 201cu.s . qualified plan 201d ) and an unfunded , non-qualified domestic noncon- tributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations ( collectively with the u.s . qualified plan , the 201cdomestic plans 201d ) ; a domestic contributory defined contribution plan ; international pension plans , which vary by country , consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans ; deferred compensation arrangements ; and certain other post- retirement benefit plans . the amounts needed to fund future payouts under our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables . cer- tain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate , expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels . we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and select assumptions that we believe reflect the economics underlying our pension and post-retirement obligations . while we believe these assumptions are within accepted industry ranges , an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings . the discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds . for fiscal 2013 , we used a discount rate for our domestic plans of 3.90% ( 3.90 % ) and vary- ing rates on our international plans of between 1.00% ( 1.00 % ) and 7.00% ( 7.00 % ) . the discount rate for our domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an aa rating , or equivalent , from a major rating agency . as of june 30 , 2013 , we used an above-mean yield curve , rather than the broad-based yield curve we used before , because we believe it represents a better estimate of an effective settlement rate of the obligation , and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of our domestic plans . the benefit obligation of our domestic plans would have been higher by approximately $ 34 mil- lion at june 30 , 2013 had we not used the above-mean yield curve . for our international plans , the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in each country , with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan . for fiscal 2013 , we used an expected return on plan assets of 7.50% ( 7.50 % ) for our u.s . qualified plan and varying rates of between 2.25% ( 2.25 % ) and 7.00% ( 7.00 % ) for our international plans . in determining the long-term rate of return for a plan , we consider the historical rates of return , the nature of the plan 2019s investments and an expectation for the plan 2019s investment strategies . see 201cnote 12 2014 pension , deferred compensation and post-retirement benefit plans 201d of notes to consolidated financial statements for details regarding the nature of our pension and post-retirement plan invest- ments . the difference between actual and expected return on plan assets is reported as a component of accu- mulated other comprehensive income . those gains/losses that are subject to amortization over future periods will be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in such future periods . for fiscal 2013 , our pension plans had actual return on assets of approximately $ 74 million as compared with expected return on assets of approximately $ 64 million . the resulting net deferred gain of approximately $ 10 million , when combined with gains and losses from previous years , will be amortized over periods ranging from approximately 7 to 22 years . the actual return on plan assets from our international pen- sion plans exceeded expectations , primarily reflecting a strong performance from fixed income and equity invest- ments . the lower than expected return on assets from our u.s . qualified plan was primarily due to weakness in our fixed income investments , partially offset by our strong equity returns . a 25 basis-point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal 2013 pension expense : 25 basis-point 25 basis-point increase decrease ( in millions ) . our post-retirement plans are comprised of health care plans that could be impacted by health care cost trend rates , which may have a significant effect on the amounts the est{e lauder companies inc . 115 .

Additionally, there were 45,541,057 additional authorizations during the year. Therefore, the total authorized shares for repurchase in 2013 were 63,046,682 + 45,541,057 = 108,587,739 shares.
Step 2: Identify the number of shares repurchased in the May 21, 2013 transaction. From the narrative, we see that the company repurchased 25,035,519 shares on May 21, 2013.
Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the total authorized share repurchase completed by the May 21, 2013 transaction. This is calculated as (25,035,519 / 108,587,739) * 100 = 23.05%.

( a ) the net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended december 31 , 2018 and 2017 was an increase of $ 12 million and an increase of $ 26 million , respectively . deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under the captions deferred charges and other assets and deferred income taxes . there was a decrease in deferred income tax assets principally relating to the utilization of u.s . federal alternative minimum tax credits as permitted under tax reform . deferred tax liabilities increased primarily due to the tax deferral of the book gain recognized on the transfer of the north american consumer packaging business to a subsidiary of graphic packaging holding company . of the $ 1.5 billion of deferred tax liabilities for forestlands , related installment sales , and investment in subsidiary , $ 884 million is attributable to an investment in subsidiary and relates to a 2006 international paper installment sale of forestlands and $ 538 million is attributable to a 2007 temple-inland installment sale of forestlands ( see note 14 ) . a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended december 31 , 2018 , 2017 and 2016 is as follows: . if the company were to prevail on the unrecognized tax benefits recorded , substantially all of the balances at december 31 , 2018 , 2017 and 2016 would benefit the effective tax rate . the company accrues interest on unrecognized tax benefits as a component of interest expense . penalties , if incurred , are recognized as a component of income tax expense . the company had approximately $ 21 million and $ 17 million accrued for the payment of estimated interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits at december 31 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively . the major jurisdictions where the company files income tax returns are the united states , brazil , france , poland and russia . generally , tax years 2006 through 2017 remain open and subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities . the company frequently faces challenges regarding the amount of taxes due . these challenges include positions taken by the company related to the timing , nature , and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions . pending audit settlements and the expiration of statute of limitations could reduce the uncertain tax positions by $ 30 million during the next twelve months . the brazilian federal revenue service has challenged the deductibility of goodwill amortization generated in a 2007 acquisition by international paper do brasil ltda. , a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company . the company received assessments for the tax years 2007-2015 totaling approximately $ 150 million in tax , and $ 380 million in interest and penalties as of december 31 , 2018 ( adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates ) . after a previous favorable ruling challenging the basis for these assessments , we received an unfavorable decision in october 2018 from the brazilian administrative council of tax appeals . the company intends to further appeal the matter in the brazilian federal courts in 2019 ; however , this tax litigation matter may take many years to resolve . the company believes that it has appropriately evaluated the transaction underlying these assessments , and has concluded based on brazilian tax law , that its tax position would be sustained . the company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for tax years subsequent to 2015 . international paper uses the flow-through method to account for investment tax credits earned on eligible open-loop biomass facilities and combined heat and power system expenditures . under this method , the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense in the year they are earned rather than a reduction in the asset basis . the company recorded a tax benefit of $ 6 million during 2018 and recorded a tax benefit of $ 68 million during 2017 related to investment tax credits earned in tax years 2013-2017. .

temple-inland , mill divestiture costs of $ 91 million , costs associated with the restructuring of our european packaging busi- ness of $ 17 million and a $ 3 million gain for other items , while operating costs in 2011 included costs associated with signing an agreement to acquire temple-inland of $ 20 million and a gain of $ 7 million for other items . industrial packaging . north american industr ia l packaging net sales were $ 11.6 billion in 2012 compared with $ 8.6 billion in 2011 and $ 8.4 billion in 2010 . operating profits in 2012 were $ 1.0 billion ( $ 1.3 billion exclud- ing costs associated with the acquisition and integration of temple-inland and mill divestiture costs ) compared with $ 1.1 billion ( both including and excluding costs associated with signing an agree- ment to acquire temple-inland ) in 2011 and $ 763 million ( $ 776 million excluding facility closure costs ) in 2010 . sales volumes for the legacy business were about flat in 2012 compared with 2011 . average sales price was lower mainly due to export containerboard sales prices which bottomed out in the first quarter but climbed steadily the rest of the year . input costs were lower for recycled fiber , wood and natural gas , but higher for starch . freight costs also increased . plan- ned maintenance downtime costs were higher than in 2011 . operating costs were higher largely due to routine inventory valuation adjustments operating profits in 2012 benefited from $ 235 million of temple-inland synergies . market-related downtime in 2012 was about 570000 tons compared with about 380000 tons in 2011 . operating profits in 2012 included $ 184 million of costs associated with the acquisition and integration of temple-inland and $ 91 million of costs associated with the divestiture of three containerboard mills . operating profits in 2011 included charges of $ 20 million for costs associated with the signing of the agreement to acquire temple- inland . looking ahead to 2013 , sales volumes in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2012 are expected to increase slightly for boxes due to a higher number of shipping days . average sales price realizations are expected to reflect the pass-through to box customers of a containerboard price increase implemented in 2012 . input costs are expected to be higher for recycled fiber , wood and starch . planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about $ 26 million higher with outages scheduled at eight mills compared with six mills in the 2012 fourth quarter . manufacturing operating costs are expected to be lower . european industr ia l packaging net sales were $ 1.0 billion in 2012 compared with $ 1.1 billion in 2011 and $ 990 million in 2010 . operating profits in 2012 were $ 53 million

costs associated with the closure of our etienne mill in france in 2009 ) in 2011 and $ 70 mil- lion ( $ 73 million before closure costs for our etienne mill ) in 2010 . sales volumes in 2012 were lower than in 2011 reflecting decreased demand for packaging in the industrial market due to a weaker overall economic environment in southern europe . demand for pack- aging in the agricultural markets was about flat year- over-year . average sales margins increased due to sales price increases implemented during 2011 and 2012 and lower board costs . other input costs were higher , primarily for energy and distribution . operat- ing profits in 2012 included a net gain of $ 10 million for an insurance settlement , partially offset by addi- tional operating costs , related to the earthquakes in northern italy in may which affected our san felice box plant . entering the first quarter of 2013 , sales volumes are expected to be stable reflecting a seasonal decrease in market demand in agricultural markets offset by an increase in industrial markets . average sales margins are expected to improve due to lower input costs for containerboard . other input costs should be about flat . operating costs are expected to be higher reflecting the absence of the earthquake insurance settlement that was received in the 2012 fourth quar- asian industr ia l packaging net sales and operating profits include the results of sca pack- aging since the acquisition on june 30 , 2010 , includ- ing the impact of incremental integration costs . net sales for the packaging operations were $ 400 million in 2012 compared with $ 410 million in 2011 and $ 255 million in 2010 . operating profits for the packaging operations were $ 2 million in 2012 compared with $ 2 million in 2011 and a loss of $ 7 million ( a loss of $ 4 million excluding facility closure costs ) in 2010 . operating profits were favorably impacted by higher average sales margins in 2012 compared with 2011 , but this benefit was offset by lower sales volumes and higher raw material costs and operating costs . looking ahead to the first quarter of 2013 , sales volumes and average sales margins are expected to decrease due to seasonality . net sales for the distribution operations were $ 260 million in 2012 compared with $ 285 million in 2011 and $ 240 million in 2010 . operating profits were $ 3 million in

Step 1: Calculate the total number of facilities owned by the company. This is done by adding the number of owned facilities in each region: United States (41), Canada (2), Europe (11), Rest of World (26). Total owned = 41 + 2 + 11 + 26 = 80.
Step 2: Calculate the total number of facilities, both owned and leased. This is done by adding the number of owned and leased facilities in each region: United States (41 + 1), Canada (2), Europe (11), Rest of World (26 + 2). Total facilities = 42 + 2 + 11 + 28 = 83.
Step 3: Calculate the portion of total facilities owned by the company. This is done by dividing the total number of owned facilities by the total number of facilities and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. Portion owned = (80 / 83) * 100 = 96.39%.

compared with $ 6.2 billion in 2013 . operating profits in 2015 were significantly higher than in both 2014 and 2013 . excluding facility closure costs , impairment costs and other special items , operating profits in 2015 were 3% ( 3 % ) lower than in 2014 and 4% ( 4 % ) higher than in 2013 . benefits from lower input costs ( $ 18 million ) , lower costs associated with the closure of our courtland , alabama mill ( $ 44 million ) and favorable foreign exchange ( $ 33 million ) were offset by lower average sales price realizations and mix ( $ 52 million ) , lower sales volumes ( $ 16 million ) , higher operating costs ( $ 18 million ) and higher planned maintenance downtime costs ( $ 26 million ) . in addition , operating profits in 2014 include special items costs of $ 554 million associated with the closure of our courtland , alabama mill . during 2013 , the company accelerated depreciation for certain courtland assets , and evaluated certain other assets for possible alternative uses by one of our other businesses . the net book value of these assets at december 31 , 2013 was approximately $ 470 million . in the first quarter of 2014 , we completed our evaluation and concluded that there were no alternative uses for these assets . we recognized approximately $ 464 million of accelerated depreciation related to these assets in 2014 . operating profits in 2014 also include a charge of $ 32 million associated with a foreign tax amnesty program , and a gain of $ 20 million for the resolution of a legal contingency in india , while operating profits in 2013 included costs of $ 118 million associated with the announced closure of our courtland , alabama mill and a $ 123 million impairment charge associated with goodwill and a trade name intangible asset in our india papers business . printing papers . north american printing papers net sales were $ 1.9 billion in 2015 , $ 2.1 billion in 2014 and $ 2.6 billion in 2013 . operating profits in 2015 were $ 179 million compared with a loss of $ 398 million ( a gain of $ 156 million excluding costs associated with the shutdown of our courtland , alabama mill ) in 2014 and a gain of $ 36 million ( $ 154 million excluding costs associated with the courtland mill shutdown ) in 2013 . sales volumes in 2015 decreased compared with 2014 primarily due to the closure of our courtland mill in 2014 . shipments to the domestic market increased , but export shipments declined . average sales price realizations decreased , primarily in the domestic market . input costs were lower , mainly for energy . planned maintenance downtime costs were $ 12 million higher in 2015 . operating profits in 2014 were negatively impacted by costs associated with the shutdown of our courtland , alabama mill . entering the first quarter of 2016 , sales volumes are expected to be up slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 . average sales margins should be about flat reflecting lower average sales price realizations offset by a more favorable product mix . input costs are expected to be stable . planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about $ 14 million lower with an outage scheduled in the 2016 first quarter at our georgetown mill compared with outages at our eastover and riverdale mills in the 2015 fourth quarter . in january 2015 , the united steelworkers , domtar corporation , packaging corporation of america , finch paper llc and p . h . glatfelter company ( the petitioners ) filed an anti-dumping petition before the united states international trade commission ( itc ) and the united states department of commerce ( doc ) alleging that paper producers in china , indonesia , australia , brazil , and portugal are selling uncoated free sheet paper in sheet form ( the products ) in violation of international trade rules . the petitioners also filed a countervailing-duties petition with these agencies regarding imports of the products from china and indonesia . in january 2016 , the doc announced its final countervailing duty rates on imports of the products to the united states from certain producers from china and indonesia . also , in january 2016 , the doc announced its final anti-dumping duty rates on imports of the products to the united states from certain producers from australia , brazil , china , indonesia and portugal . in february 2016 , the itc concluded its anti- dumping and countervailing duties investigations and made a final determination that the u.s . market had been injured by imports of the products . accordingly , the doc 2019s previously announced countervailing duty rates and anti-dumping duty rates will be in effect for a minimum of five years . we do not believe the impact of these rates will have a material , adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements . brazilian papers net sales for 2015 were $ 878 million compared with $ 1.1 billion in 2014 and $ 1.1 billion in 2013 . operating profits for 2015 were $ 186 million compared with $ 177 million ( $ 209 million excluding costs associated with a tax amnesty program ) in 2014 and $ 210 million in 2013 . sales volumes in 2015 were lower compared with 2014 reflecting weak economic conditions and the absence of 2014 one-time events . average sales price realizations improved for domestic uncoated freesheet paper due to the realization of price increases implemented in the second half of 2015 . margins were unfavorably affected by an increased proportion of sales to the lower-margin export markets . raw material costs increased for energy and wood . operating costs were higher than in 2014 , while planned maintenance downtime costs were $ 4 million lower. .

2011 compared to 2010 mfc 2019s net sales for 2011 increased $ 533 million , or 8% ( 8 % ) , compared to 2010 . the increase was attributable to higher volume of about $ 420 million on air and missile defense programs ( primarily pac-3 and thaad ) ; and about $ 245 million from fire control systems programs primarily related to the sof clss program , which began late in the third quarter of 2010 . partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales due to decreased volume of approximately $ 75 million primarily from various services programs and approximately $ 20 million from tactical missile programs ( primarily mlrs and jassm ) . mfc 2019s operating profit for 2011 increased $ 96 million , or 10% ( 10 % ) , compared to 2010 . the increase was attributable to higher operating profit of about $ 60 million for air and missile defense programs ( primarily pac-3 and thaad ) as a result of increased volume and retirement of risks ; and approximately $ 25 million for various services programs . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit rate adjustments described above , were approximately $ 35 million higher in 2011 compared to 2010 . backlog backlog increased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to increased orders and lower sales on fire control systems programs ( primarily lantirn ae and sniper ae ) and on various services programs , partially offset by lower orders and higher sales volume on tactical missiles programs . backlog increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased orders on air and missile defense programs ( primarily thaad ) . trends we expect mfc 2019s net sales for 2013 will be comparable with 2012 . we expect low double digit percentage growth in air and missile defense programs , offset by an expected decline in volume on logistics services programs . operating profit and margin are expected to be comparable with 2012 results . mission systems and training our mst business segment provides surface ship and submarine combat systems ; sea and land-based missile defense systems ; radar systems ; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft ; littoral combat ships ; simulation and training services ; unmanned technologies and platforms ; ship systems integration ; and military and commercial training systems . mst 2019s major programs include aegis , mk-41 vertical launching system ( vls ) , tpq-53 radar system , mh-60 , lcs , and ptds . mst 2019s operating results included the following ( in millions ) : . 2012 compared to 2011 mst 2019s net sales for 2012 increased $ 447 million , or 6% ( 6 % ) , compared to 2011 . the increase in net sales for 2012 was attributable to higher volume and risk retirements of approximately $ 395 million from ship and aviation system programs ( primarily ptds ; lcs ; vls ; and mh-60 ) ; about $ 115 million for training and logistics solutions programs primarily due to net sales from sim industries , which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 ; and approximately $ 30 million as a result of increased volume on integrated warfare systems and sensors programs ( primarily aegis ) . partially offsetting the increases were lower net sales of approximately $ 70 million from undersea systems programs due to lower volume on an international combat system program and towed array systems ; and about $ 25 million due to lower volume on various other programs . mst 2019s operating profit for 2012 increased $ 92 million , or 14% ( 14 % ) , compared to 2011 . the increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $ 175 million from ship and aviation system programs , which reflects higher volume and risk retirements on certain programs ( primarily vls ; ptds ; mh-60 ; and lcs ) and reserves of about $ 55 million for contract cost matters on ship and aviation system programs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 ( including the terminated presidential helicopter program ) . partially offsetting the increase was lower operating profit of approximately $ 40 million from undersea systems programs due to reduced profit booking rates on certain programs and lower volume on an international combat system program and towed array systems ; and about $ 40 million due to lower volume on various other programs . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above , were approximately $ 150 million higher for 2012 compared to 2011. .

the analysis of our depreciation studies . changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively . under group depreciation , the historical cost ( net of salvage ) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized . the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using ( i ) inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ( ii ) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies . the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes . because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired , we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate . in addition , we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient ( or in excess ) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies . any deficiency ( or excess ) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets . for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business , a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions : ( i ) is unusual , ( ii ) is material in amount , and ( iii ) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies . a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations . when we purchase an asset , we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use . however , many of our assets are self-constructed . a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties , which is typically performed by our employees , and for track line expansion and other capacity projects . costs that are directly attributable to capital projects ( including overhead costs ) are capitalized . direct costs that are capitalized as part of self- constructed assets include material , labor , and work equipment . indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset . general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred . normal repairs and maintenance , including rail grinding , are also expensed as incurred , while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset , improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized . these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases . total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was $ 2.1 billion for 2012 , $ 2.2 billion for 2011 , and $ 2.0 billion for 2010 . assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease . amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease . 12 . accounts payable and other current liabilities dec . 31 , dec . 31 , millions 2012 2011 . .

adobe systems incorporated notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) accounting for uncertainty in income taxes during fiscal 2013 and 2012 , our aggregate changes in our total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized as follows ( in thousands ) : . as of november 29 , 2013 , the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns and included in non-current income taxes payable was approximately $ 11.4 million . we file income tax returns in the u.s . on a federal basis and in many u.s . state and foreign jurisdictions . we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities . our major tax jurisdictions are the u.s. , ireland and california . for california , ireland and the u.s. , the earliest fiscal years open for examination are 2005 , 2006 and 2010 , respectively . we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations . we believe such estimates to be reasonable ; however , there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position . in july 2013 , a u.s . income tax examination covering our fiscal years 2008 and 2009 was completed . our accrued tax and interest related to these years was $ 48.4 million and was previously reported in long-term income taxes payable . we settled the tax obligation resulting from this examination with cash and income tax assets totaling $ 41.2 million , and the resulting $ 7.2 million income tax benefit was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 . the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process . these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities . we believe that within the next 12 months , it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire , or both . given the uncertainties described above , we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $ 0 to approximately $ 5 million . note 10 . restructuring fiscal 2011 restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 , we initiated a restructuring plan consisting of reductions in workforce and the consolidation of facilities in order to better align our resources around our digital media and digital marketing strategies . during fiscal 2013 , we continued to implement restructuring activities under this plan . total costs incurred to date and expected to be incurred for closing redundant facilities are $ 12.2 million as all facilities under this plan have been exited as of november 29 , 2013 . other restructuring plans other restructuring plans include other adobe plans and other plans associated with certain of our acquisitions that are substantially complete . we continue to make cash outlays to settle obligations under these plans , however the current impact to our consolidated financial statements is not significant . our other restructuring plans primarily consist of the 2009 restructuring plan , which was implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 , in order to appropriately align our costs in connection with our fiscal 2010 operating plan. .

our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined , including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries , the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses , including depreciation . the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil , commonly used by the industry as an indicator of the impact of price on the refining margin . crack spreads can fluctuate significantly , particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil . as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants , we calculate midwest ( chicago ) and u.s . gulf coast crack spreads that we feel most closely track our operations and slate of products . posted light louisiana sweet ( 201clls 201d ) prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products ( 6 barrels of crude oil producing 3 barrels of gasoline , 2 barrels of distillate and 1 barrel of residual fuel ) are used for the crack spread calculation . the following table lists calculated average crack spreads by quarter for the midwest ( chicago ) and gulf coast markets in 2008 . crack spreads ( dollars per barrel ) 1st qtr 2nd qtr 3rd qtr 4th qtr 2008 . in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads , our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed , the selling prices realized for refined products , the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to mitigate price risk and the cost of purchased products for resale . we process significant amounts of sour crude oil which can enhance our profitability compared to certain of our competitors , as sour crude oil typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil . finally , our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by changes in manufacturing costs , which are primarily driven by the level of maintenance activities at the refineries and the price of purchased natural gas used for plant fuel . our 2008 refining and wholesale marketing gross margin was the key driver of the 43 percent decrease in rm&t segment income when compared to 2007 . our average refining and wholesale marketing gross margin per gallon decreased 37 percent , to 11.66 cents in 2008 from 18.48 cents in 2007 , primarily due to the significant and rapid increases in crude oil prices early in 2008 and lagging wholesale price realizations . our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillates , which is the difference between the ultimate price paid by consumers and the cost of refined products , including secondary transportation and consumer excise taxes , also impacts rm&t segment profitability . while on average demand has been increasing for several years , there are numerous factors including local competition , seasonal demand fluctuations , the available wholesale supply , the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions that impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year . in 2008 , demand began to drop due to the combination of significant increases in retail petroleum prices and a broad slowdown in general activity . the gross margin on merchandise sold at retail outlets has historically been more constant . the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations is primarily dependent on the volumes shipped through our crude oil and refined products pipelines . the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of , and refiner demand for , crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines . key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers , the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation , and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels . the volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of , and user demand for , refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines . in most of our markets , demand for gasoline peaks during the summer and declines during the fall and winter months , whereas distillate demand is more ratable throughout the year . as with crude oil , other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements . integrated gas our integrated gas strategy is to link stranded natural gas resources with areas where a supply gap is emerging due to declining production and growing demand . our integrated gas operations include marketing and transportation of products manufactured from natural gas , such as lng and methanol , primarily in the u.s. , europe and west africa . our most significant lng investment is our 60 percent ownership in a production facility in equatorial guinea , which sells lng under a long-term contract at prices tied to henry hub natural gas prices . in 2008 , its .

liquidity and capital resources as of december 31 , 2006 , our principal sources of liquidity included cash , cash equivalents , the sale of receivables , and our revolving credit facilities , as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets . we had $ 2 billion of committed credit facilities available , of which there were no borrowings outstanding as of december 31 , 2006 , and we did not make any short-term borrowings under these facilities during the year . the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the sale of receivables program was $ 600 million as of december 31 , 2006 . the sale of receivables program is subject to certain requirements , including the maintenance of an investment grade bond rating . if our bond rating were to deteriorate , it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity . access to commercial paper is dependent on market conditions . deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to utilize commercial paper as a source of liquidity . liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability . at both december 31 , 2006 and 2005 , we had a working capital deficit of approximately $ 1.1 billion . a working capital deficit is common in our industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity . we maintain adequate resources to meet our daily cash requirements , and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities . financial condition cash flows millions of dollars 2006 2005 2004 . cash provided by operating activities 2013 higher income in 2006 generated the increased cash provided by operating activities , which was partially offset by higher income tax payments , $ 150 million in voluntary pension contributions , higher material and supply inventories , and higher management incentive payments in 2006 . higher income , lower management incentive payments in 2005 ( executive bonuses , which would have been paid to individuals in 2005 , were not awarded based on company performance in 2004 and bonuses for the professional workforce that were paid out in 2005 were significantly reduced ) , and working capital performance generated higher cash from operating activities in 2005 . a voluntary pension contribution of $ 100 million in 2004 also augmented the positive year-over-year variance in 2005 as no pension contribution was made in 2005 . this improvement was partially offset by cash received in 2004 for income tax refunds . cash used in investing activities 2013 an insurance settlement for the 2005 january west coast storm and lower balances for work in process decreased the amount of cash used in investing activities in 2006 . higher capital investments and lower proceeds from asset sales partially offset this decrease . increased capital spending , partially offset by higher proceeds from asset sales , increased the amount of cash used in investing activities in 2005 compared to 2004 . cash used in financing activities 2013 the increase in cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from lower net proceeds from equity compensation plans ( $ 189 million in 2006 compared to $ 262 million in 2005 ) . the increase in 2005 results from debt issuances in 2004 and higher debt repayments in 2005 . we did not issue debt in 2005 versus $ 745 million of debt issuances in 2004 , and we repaid $ 699 million of debt in 2005 compared to $ 588 million in 2004 . the higher outflows in 2005 were partially offset by higher net proceeds from equity compensation plans ( $ 262 million in 2005 compared to $ 80 million in 2004 ) . .

distribution model as part of business restructuring and operational excellence initiatives . the terminated contracts primarily relate to sales agents and distribution agreements . contingent consideration adjustments represent the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations to be paid to the prior owners of acquired businesses . accelerated software amortization is the incremental amortization resulting from a reduction in the estimated life of certain software . in 2012 , we approved a plan to replace certain software . as a result , the estimated economic useful life of the existing software was decreased to represent the period of time expected to implement replacement software . as a result , the amortization from the shortened life of this software is substantially higher than the previous amortization being recognized . cash and cash equivalents 2013 we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents . the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents are valued at cost , which approximates their fair value. .

risks relating to our business fluctuations in the financial markets could result in investment losses . prolonged and severe disruptions in the overall public debt and equity markets , such as occurred during 2008 , could result in significant realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio . although financial markets have significantly improved since 2008 , they could deteriorate in the future . there could also be disruption in individual market sectors , such as occurred in the energy sector in recent years . such declines in the financial markets could result in significant realized and unrealized losses on investments and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations , equity , business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings . our results could be adversely affected by catastrophic events . we are exposed to unpredictable catastrophic events , including weather-related and other natural catastrophes , as well as acts of terrorism . any material reduction in our operating results caused by the occurrence of one or more catastrophes could inhibit our ability to pay dividends or to meet our interest and principal payment obligations . by way of illustration , during the past five calendar years , pre-tax catastrophe losses , net of contract specific reinsurance but before cessions under corporate reinsurance programs , were as follows: . our losses from future catastrophic events could exceed our projections . we use projections of possible losses from future catastrophic events of varying types and magnitudes as a strategic underwriting tool . we use these loss projections to estimate our potential catastrophe losses in certain geographic areas and decide on the placement of retrocessional coverage or other actions to limit the extent of potential losses in a given geographic area . these loss projections are approximations , reliant on a mix of quantitative and qualitative processes , and actual losses may exceed the projections by a material amount , resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. .

associated with the closure of our etienne mill in france in 2009 ) in 2011 . sales volumes in 2013 were higher than in 2012 reflecting strong demand for packaging in the agricultural markets in morocco and turkey . in europe , sales volumes decreased slightly due to continuing weak demand for packaging in the industrial markets , and lower demand for packaging in the agricultural markets resulting from poor weather conditions . average sales margins were significantly lower due to input costs for containerboard rising ahead of box sales price increases . other input costs were also higher , primarily for energy . operating profits in 2013 and 2012 included net gains of $ 13 million and $ 10 million , respectively , for insurance settlements and italian government grants , partially offset by additional operating costs , related to the earthquakes in northern italy in may 2012 which affected our san felice box plant . entering the first quarter of 2014 , sales volumes are expected to increase slightly reflecting higher demand for packaging in the industrial markets . average sales margins are expected to gradually improve as a result of slight reductions in material costs and planned box price increases . other input costs should be about flat . brazilian industrial packaging includes the results of orsa international paper embalagens s.a. , a corrugated packaging producer in which international paper acquired a 75% ( 75 % ) share in january 2013 . net sales were $ 335 million in 2013 . operating profits in 2013 were a loss of $ 2 million ( a gain of

Step 2: The narrative context mentions a pre-tax restructuring charge of $83 million recorded in the second quarter of 2018, offset by certain changes in estimates to complete previously recorded programs of $17 million. This gives a net restructuring cost of $66 million for 2018.

the long term . in addition , we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as airtel , telef f3nica s.a . and vodafone group plc . we believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward . in emerging markets , such as ghana , india , nigeria and uganda , wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states , and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas . a majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services , predominantly on feature phones , while advanced device penetration remains low . in more developed urban locations within these markets , early-stage data network deployments are underway . carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate . in markets with rapidly evolving network technology , such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business , initial voice networks , for the most part , have already been built out , and carriers are focused on 3g network build outs , with select investments in 4g technology . consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices , and as a result , the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially . recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks . smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly , which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service . finally , in markets with more mature network technology , such as germany , carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage amongst their customer base . with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage , carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity . we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states , which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years , will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets . as a result , we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 60190 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable , long-term growth . we have holistic master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent , long-term revenue and a reduction in the likelihood of churn . our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times , thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites . property operations new site revenue growth . during the year ended december 31 , 2015 , we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 25370 sites . in a majority of our asia , emea and latin america markets , the acquisition or construction of new sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass- through revenues ( such as ground rent or power and fuel costs ) and expenses . we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios , both domestically and internationally , to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. . property operations expenses . direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs , some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants , as well as property taxes , repairs and maintenance . these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling , general , administrative and development expenses , which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling , general , administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations . in general , our property segments 2019 selling , general , administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year . as a result , leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow . we may , however , incur additional segment .

2012 ppg annual report and form 10-k 45 costs related to these notes , which totaled $ 17 million , will be amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the notes . in august 2010 , ppg entered into a three-year credit agreement with several banks and financial institutions ( the ""2010 credit agreement"" ) which was subsequently terminated in july 2012 . the 2010 credit agreement provided for a $ 1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility . in connection with entering into the 2010 credit agreement , the company terminated its 20ac650 million and its $ 1 billion revolving credit facilities that were each set to expire in 2011 . there were no outstanding amounts due under either revolving facility at the times of their termination . the 2010 credit agreement was set to terminate on august 5 , 2013 . ppg 2019s non-u.s . operations have uncommitted lines of credit totaling $ 705 million of which $ 34 million was used as of december 31 , 2012 . these uncommitted lines of credit are subject to cancellation at any time and are generally not subject to any commitment fees . short-term debt outstanding as of december 31 , 2012 and 2011 , was as follows: . ppg is in compliance with the restrictive covenants under its various credit agreements , loan agreements and indentures . the company 2019s revolving credit agreements include a financial ratio covenant . the covenant requires that the amount of total indebtedness not exceed 60% ( 60 % ) of the company 2019s total capitalization excluding the portion of accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) related to pensions and other postretirement benefit adjustments . as of december 31 , 2012 , total indebtedness was 42% ( 42 % ) of the company 2019s total capitalization excluding the portion of accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) related to pensions and other postretirement benefit adjustments . additionally , substantially all of the company 2019s debt agreements contain customary cross- default provisions . those provisions generally provide that a default on a debt service payment of $ 10 million or more for longer than the grace period provided ( usually 10 days ) under one agreement may result in an event of default under other agreements . none of the company 2019s primary debt obligations are secured or guaranteed by the company 2019s affiliates . interest payments in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 totaled $ 219 million , $ 212 million and $ 189 million , respectively . in october 2009 , the company entered into an agreement with a counterparty to repurchase up to 1.2 million shares of the company 2019s stock of which 1.1 million shares were purchased in the open market ( 465006 of these shares were purchased as of december 31 , 2009 at a weighted average price of $ 56.66 per share ) . the counterparty held the shares until september of 2010 when the company paid $ 65 million and took possession of these shares . rental expense for operating leases was $ 233 million , $ 249 million and $ 233 million in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively . the primary leased assets include paint stores , transportation equipment , warehouses and other distribution facilities , and office space , including the company 2019s corporate headquarters located in pittsburgh , pa . minimum lease commitments for operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of december 31 , 2012 , are ( in millions ) $ 171 in 2013 , $ 135 in 2014 , $ 107 in 2015 , $ 83 in 2016 , $ 64 in 2017 and $ 135 thereafter . the company had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $ 119 million as of december 31 , 2012 . the letters of credit secure the company 2019s performance to third parties under certain self-insurance programs and other commitments made in the ordinary course of business . as of december 31 , 2012 and 2011 , guarantees outstanding were $ 96 million and $ 90 million , respectively . the guarantees relate primarily to debt of certain entities in which ppg has an ownership interest and selected customers of certain of the company 2019s businesses . a portion of such debt is secured by the assets of the related entities . the carrying values of these guarantees were $ 11 million and $ 13 million as of december 31 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively , and the fair values were $ 11 million and $ 21 million , as of december 31 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively . the fair value of each guarantee was estimated by comparing the net present value of two hypothetical cash flow streams , one based on ppg 2019s incremental borrowing rate and the other based on the borrower 2019s incremental borrowing rate , as of the effective date of the guarantee . both streams were discounted at a risk free rate of return . the company does not believe any loss related to these letters of credit , surety bonds or guarantees is likely . 9 . fair value measurement the accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy with three levels of inputs used to determine fair value . level 1 inputs are quoted prices ( unadjusted ) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities , are considered to be the most reliable evidence of fair value , and should be used whenever available . level 2 inputs are observable prices that are not quoted on active exchanges . level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs employed for measuring the fair value of assets or liabilities . table of contents notes to the consolidated financial statements .

our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and is generally sold in relation to the brent crude benchmark . the differential between wti and brent average prices widened significantly in 2011 and remained in 2012 in comparison to almost no differential in 2010 . natural gas 2013 a significant portion of our natural gas production in the lower 48 states of the u.s . is sold at bid-week prices or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas . average henry hub settlement prices for natural gas were lower in 2012 than in recent years . a decline in average settlement date henry hub natural gas prices began in september 2011 and continued into 2012 . although prices stabilized in late 2012 , they have not increased appreciably . our other major natural gas-producing regions are e.g . and europe . in the case of e.g . our natural gas sales are subject to term contracts , making realizations less volatile . because natural gas sales from e.g . are at fixed prices , our worldwide reported average natural gas realizations may not fully track market price movements . natural gas prices in europe have been significantly higher than in the u.s . oil sands mining the osm segment produces and sells various qualities of synthetic crude oil . output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mines or upgrader . sales prices for roughly two-thirds of the normal output mix will track movements in wti and one-third will track movements in the canadian heavy sour crude oil marker , primarily wcs . in 2012 , the wcs discount from wti had increased , putting downward pressure on our average realizations . the operating cost structure of the osm operations is predominantly fixed and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime . per-unit costs are sensitive to production rates . key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel , which track commodity markets such as the canadian alberta energy company ( ""aeco"" ) natural gas sales index and crude oil prices , respectively . the table below shows average benchmark prices that impact both our revenues and variable costs. . wcs ( dollars per bbl ) ( a ) $ 73.18 $ 77.97 $ 65.31 aeco natural gas sales index ( dollars per mmbtu ) ( b ) $ 2.39 $ 3.68 $ 3.89 ( a ) monthly pricing based upon average wti adjusted for differentials unique to western canada . ( b ) monthly average day ahead index . integrated gas our ig operations include production and marketing of products manufactured from natural gas , such as lng and methanol , in e.g . world lng trade in 2012 has been estimated to be 240 mmt . long-term , lng continues to be in demand as markets seek the benefits of clean burning natural gas . market prices for lng are not reported or posted . in general , lng delivered to the u.s . is tied to henry hub prices and will track with changes in u.s . natural gas prices , while lng sold in europe and asia is indexed to crude oil prices and will track the movement of those prices . we have a 60 percent ownership in an lng production facility in e.g. , which sells lng under a long-term contract at prices tied to henry hub natural gas prices . gross sales from the plant were 3.8 mmt , 4.1 mmt and 3.7 mmt in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 . we own a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in e.g . through our investment in ampco . gross sales of methanol from the plant totaled 1.1 mmt , 1.0 mmt and 0.9 mmt in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 . methanol demand has a direct impact on ampco 2019s earnings . because global demand for methanol is rather limited , changes in the supply-demand balance can have a significant impact on sales prices . world demand for methanol in 2012 has been estimated to be 49 mmt . our plant capacity of 1.1 mmt is about 2 percent of world demand. .

course of business , we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions , authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities . the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions . we establish credit limits for each counterparty . our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments . for information on interest rate , foreign exchange , commodity price , and equity instrument risk , please see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report . value at risk the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates , foreign exchange rates , commodity prices , and equity prices under normal market conditions . a monte carlo value-at-risk ( var ) methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures . the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level . the var calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates , and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future . the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics 2122 data set . the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur . further , since the hedging instrument ( the derivative ) inversely correlates with the underlying exposure , we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure . the positions included in the calculations were : debt ; investments ; interest rate swaps ; foreign exchange forwards ; commodity swaps , futures , and options ; and equity instruments . the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equity-related positions that are offset by these market-risk-sensitive instruments . the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a one-day loss in fair value for our interest rate , foreign currency , commodity , and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding as of may 27 , 2018 and may 28 , 2017 , and the average fair value impact during the year ended may 27 , 2018. . .

( a ) other changes in expected cash flows may vary from period to period as the firm continues to refine its cash flow model and periodically updates model assumptions . for the years ended december 31 , 2010 and 2009 , other changes in expected cash flows were principally driven by changes in prepayment assumptions , as well as reclassification to the nonaccretable difference . such changes are expected to have an insignificant impact on the accretable yield percentage . the factors that most significantly affect estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected , and accordingly the accretable yield balance , include : ( i ) changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable rate products such as option arm and home equity loans ; and ( ii ) changes in prepayment assump- tions . to date , the decrease in the accretable yield percentage has been primarily related to a decrease in interest rates on vari- able-rate loans and , to a lesser extent , extended loan liquida- tion periods . certain events , such as extended loan liquidation periods , affect the timing of expected cash flows but not the amount of cash expected to be received ( i.e. , the accretable yield balance ) . extended loan liquidation periods reduce the accretable yield percentage because the same accretable yield balance is recognized against a higher-than-expected loan balance over a longer-than-expected period of time. .

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates , foreign exchange rates , commodity prices and equity prices . changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows . in the normal course of business , we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging trans- actions , authorized under our policies that place clear controls on these activities . the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions . we establish credit limits for each counterparty . our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of deriv- ative financial instruments . interest rates we manage our debt structure and our interest rate risk through the use of fixed- and floating-rate debt and derivatives . we use interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce volatility of our financing costs . generally under these swaps , we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed- rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal amount . our primary exposure is to u.s . interest rates . as of may 28 , 2006 , we had $ 7.0 billion of aggregate notional principal amount ( the principal amount on which the fixed or floating interest rate is calculated ) outstanding . this includes notional amounts of offsetting swaps that neutralize our exposure to interest rates on other interest rate swaps . see note six to the consolidated finan- cial statements on pages 40 through 42 in item eight of this report . foreign currency rates foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies . we primarily use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to selectively hedge our cash flow exposure to changes in exchange rates . these contracts function as hedges , since they change in value inversely to the change created in the underlying exposure as foreign exchange rates fluctuate . our primary u.s . dollar exchange rate exposures are with the canadian dollar , the euro , the australian dollar , the mexican peso and the british pound . commodities many commodities we use in the produc- tion and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks . we manage this market risk through an inte- grated set of financial instruments , including purchase orders , noncancelable contracts , futures contracts , options and swaps . our primary commodity price exposures are to cereal grains , sugar , dairy products , vegetables , fruits , meats , vegetable oils , and other agricultural products , as well as paper and plastic packaging materials , operating supplies and energy . equity instruments equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments owned by our employees are revalued . we use equity swaps to manage this market risk . value at risk these estimates are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates , foreign exchange rates , commodity prices , or equity prices under normal market conditions . a monte carlo ( var ) method- ology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures . the models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level . the var calculation used historical interest rates , foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future . the market data were drawn from the riskmetricstm data set . the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur . further , since the hedging instrument ( the derivative ) inversely correlates with the underlying expo- sure , we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures . the positions included in the calculations were : debt ; invest- ments ; interest rate swaps ; foreign exchange forwards ; commodity swaps , futures and options ; and equity instru- ments . the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities-related positions that are hedged by these market-risk-sensitive instruments . the table below presents the estimated maximum poten- tial one-day loss in fair value for our interest rate , foreign currency , commodity and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding on may 28 , 2006 and may 29 , 2005 , and the average amount outstanding during the year ended may 28 , 2006 . the amounts were calculated using the var methodology described above. . .

notes to consolidated financial statements 2013 ( continued ) ( amounts in millions , except per share amounts ) guarantees we have guaranteed certain obligations of our subsidiaries relating principally to operating leases and uncommitted lines of credit of certain subsidiaries . as of december 31 , 2018 and 2017 , the amount of parent company guarantees on lease obligations was $ 824.5 and $ 829.2 , respectively , the amount of parent company guarantees primarily relating to uncommitted lines of credit was $ 349.1 and $ 308.8 , respectively , and the amount of parent company guarantees related to daylight overdrafts , primarily utilized to manage intra-day overdrafts due to timing of transactions under cash pooling arrangements without resulting in incremental borrowings , was $ 207.8 and $ 182.2 , respectively . in the event of non-payment by the applicable subsidiary of the obligations covered by a guarantee , we would be obligated to pay the amounts covered by that guarantee . as of december 31 , 2018 , there were no material assets pledged as security for such parent company guarantees . contingent acquisition obligations the following table details the estimated future contingent acquisition obligations payable in cash as of december 31 . 1 we have entered into certain acquisitions that contain both redeemable noncontrolling interests and call options with similar terms and conditions . the estimated amounts listed would be paid in the event of exercise at the earliest exercise date . we have certain redeemable noncontrolling interests that are exercisable at the discretion of the noncontrolling equity owners as of december 31 , 2018 . these estimated payments of $ 24.9 are included within the total payments expected to be made in 2019 , and will continue to be carried forward into 2020 or beyond until exercised or expired . redeemable noncontrolling interests are included in the table at current exercise price payable in cash , not at applicable redemption value , in accordance with the authoritative guidance for classification and measurement of redeemable securities . the majority of these payments are contingent upon achieving projected operating performance targets and satisfying other conditions specified in the related agreements and are subject to revision in accordance with the terms of the respective agreements . see note 5 for further information relating to the payment structure of our acquisitions . legal matters we are involved in various legal proceedings , and subject to investigations , inspections , audits , inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the normal course of business . the types of allegations that arise in connection with such legal proceedings vary in nature , but can include claims related to contract , employment , tax and intellectual property matters . we evaluate all cases each reporting period and record liabilities for losses from legal proceedings when we determine that it is probable that the outcome in a legal proceeding will be unfavorable and the amount , or potential range , of loss can be reasonably estimated . in certain cases , we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss because , for example , the litigation is in its early stages . while any outcome related to litigation or such governmental proceedings in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty , management believes that the outcome of these matters , individually and in the aggregate , will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition , results of operations or cash flows . as previously disclosed , on april 10 , 2015 , a federal judge in brazil authorized the search of the records of an agency 2019s offices in s e3o paulo and brasilia , in connection with an ongoing investigation by brazilian authorities involving payments potentially connected to local government contracts . the company had previously investigated the matter and taken a number of remedial and disciplinary actions . the company has been in the process of concluding a settlement related to these matters with government agencies , and that settlement was fully executed in april 2018 . the company has previously provided for such settlement in its consolidated financial statements. .

note 9 . retirement plan we maintain a defined contribution pension plan covering full-time shoreside employees who have completed the minimum period of continuous service . annual contributions to the plan are based on fixed percentages of participants 2019 salaries and years of service , not to exceed certain maximums . pension cost was $ 13.9 million , $ 12.8 million and $ 12.2 million for the years ended december 31 , 2006 , 2005 and 2004 , respectively . note 10 . income taxes we and the majority of our subsidiaries are currently exempt from united states corporate tax on income from the international opera- tion of ships pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code . income tax expense related to our remaining subsidiaries was not significant for the years ended december 31 , 2006 , 2005 and 2004 . final regulations under section 883 were published on august 26 , 2003 , and were effective for the year ended december 31 , 2005 . these regulations confirmed that we qualify for the exemption provid- ed by section 883 , but also narrowed the scope of activities which are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships . the activities listed in the regula- tions as not being incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of air and other transportation such as transfers , shore excursions and pre and post cruise tours . to the extent the income from such activities is earned from sources within the united states , such income will be subject to united states taxa- tion . the application of these new regulations reduced our net income for the years ended december 31 , 2006 and december 31 , 2005 by approximately $ 6.3 million and $ 14.0 million , respectively . note 11 . financial instruments the estimated fair values of our financial instruments are as follows ( in thousands ) : . long-term debt ( including current portion of long-term debt ) ( 5474988 ) ( 4368874 ) foreign currency forward contracts in a net ( loss ) gain position 104159 ( 115415 ) interest rate swap agreements in a net receivable position 5856 8456 fuel swap agreements in a net payable position ( 20456 ) ( 78 ) the reported fair values are based on a variety of factors and assumptions . accordingly , the fair values may not represent actual values of the financial instruments that could have been realized as of december 31 , 2006 or 2005 , or that will be realized in the future and do not include expenses that could be incurred in an actual sale or settlement . our financial instruments are not held for trading or speculative purposes . our exposure under foreign currency contracts , interest rate and fuel swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to the contracts , all of which are currently our lending banks . to minimize this risk , we select counterparties with credit risks acceptable to us and we limit our exposure to an individual counterparty . furthermore , all foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in primary currencies . cash and cash equivalents the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to the short maturity of these instruments . long-term debt the fair values of our senior notes and senior debentures were esti- mated by obtaining quoted market prices . the fair values of all other debt were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on market rates available to us for similar debt with the same remaining maturities . foreign currency contracts the fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were esti- mated using current market prices for similar instruments . our expo- sure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to six ship construction contracts and forecasted transactions . we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates . as of december 31 , 2006 , we had foreign currency forward contracts in a notional amount of $ 3.8 billion maturing through 2009 . as of december 31 , 2006 , the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts related to the six ship construction contracts , which are designated as fair value hedges , was a net unrealized gain of approximately $ 106.3 mil- lion . at december 31 , 2005 , the fair value of our foreign currency for- ward contracts related to three ship construction contracts , designated as fair value hedges , was a net unrealized loss of approx- imately $ 103.4 million . the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts related to the other ship construction contract at december 31 , 2005 , which was designated as a cash flow hedge , was an unre- alized loss , of approximately $ 7.8 million . at december 31 , 2006 , approximately 11% ( 11 % ) of the aggregate cost of the ships was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate . r o y a l c a r i b b e a n c r u i s e s l t d . 3 5 notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued ) 51392_financials-v9.qxp 6/7/07 3:40 pm page

and 2022 an increase to pretax income of $ 464 million ( $ 288 million after-tax ) related to valuations of nonpublic private equity investments . prior to the adoption of sfas 157 , the firm applied the provisions of eitf 02-3 to its derivative portfolio . eitf 02-3 precluded the recogni- tion of initial trading profit in the absence of : ( a ) quoted market prices , ( b ) observable prices of other current market transactions or ( c ) other observable data supporting a valuation technique . in accor- dance with eitf 02-3 , the firm recognized the deferred profit in principal transactions revenue on a systematic basis ( typically straight- line amortization over the life of the instruments ) and when observ- able market data became available . prior to the adoption of sfas 157 the firm did not incorporate an adjustment into the valuation of liabilities carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet . commencing january 1 , 2007 , in accor- dance with the requirements of sfas 157 , an adjustment was made to the valuation of liabilities measured at fair value to reflect the credit quality of the firm . prior to the adoption of sfas 157 , privately held investments were initially valued based upon cost . the carrying values of privately held investments were adjusted from cost to reflect both positive and neg- ative changes evidenced by financing events with third-party capital providers . the investments were also subject to ongoing impairment reviews by private equity senior investment professionals . the increase in pretax income related to nonpublic private equity investments in connection with the adoption of sfas 157 was due to there being sufficient market evidence to support an increase in fair values using the sfas 157 methodology , although there had not been an actual third-party market transaction related to such investments . financial disclosures required by sfas 107 sfas 107 requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments and the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate their fair values . many but not all of the financial instruments held by the firm are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets . financial instruments within the scope of sfas 107 that are not carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are discussed below . additionally , certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments are excluded from the scope of sfas 107 . accordingly , the fair value disclosures required by sfas 107 provide only a partial estimate of the fair value of jpmorgan chase . for example , the firm has developed long-term relationships with its customers through its deposit base and credit card accounts , commonly referred to as core deposit intangibles and credit card relationships . in the opinion of management , these items , in the aggregate , add significant value to jpmorgan chase , but their fair value is not disclosed in this note . financial instruments for which fair value approximates carrying value certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approxi- mate fair value due to their short-term nature and generally negligi- ble credit risk . these instruments include cash and due from banks , deposits with banks , federal funds sold , securities purchased under resale agreements with short-dated maturities , securities borrowed , short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable , commercial paper , federal funds purchased , securities sold under repurchase agreements with short-dated maturities , other borrowed funds , accounts payable and accrued liabilities . in addition , sfas 107 requires that the fair value for deposit liabilities with no stated matu- rity ( i.e. , demand , savings and certain money market deposits ) be equal to their carrying value . sfas 107 does not allow for the recog- nition of the inherent funding value of these instruments. .

The table provides information about the number of shares purchased by employees in 2009 and the weighted average price per share. To find the total cash received from shares purchased by employees in 2009, we need to multiply the number of shares purchased by the weighted average price per share.
Step 1: Number of shares purchased by employees in 2009 = 77,509
Step 2: Weighted average price per share in 2009 = $23.91
Step 3: Total cash received from shares purchased by employees in 2009 = Number of shares * Weighted average price per share = 77,509 * 23.91 = $1,852,440.19
However, the question asks for the answer in millions. Therefore, we need to convert this amount into millions.
Step 4: Total cash received from shares purchased by employees in 2009 in millions = $1,852,440.19 / 1,000,000 = $1.85244 million

aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2012 increased $ 69 million , or 4% ( 4 % ) , compared to 2011 . the increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $ 105 million from c-130 programs due to an increase in risk retirements ; about $ 50 million from f-16 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries partially offset by a decline in risk retirements ; approximately $ 50 million from f-35 production contracts due to increased production volume and risk retirements ; and about $ 50 million from the completion of purchased intangible asset amortization on certain f-16 contracts . partially offsetting the increases was lower operating profit of about $ 90 million from the f-35 development contract primarily due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012 ; approximately $ 50 million from decreased production volume and risk retirements on the f-22 program partially offset by a resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012 ; and approximately $ 45 million primarily due to a decrease in risk retirements on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other aeronautics programs due to increased risk retirements and volume . operating profit for c-5 programs was comparable to 2011 . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above , were approximately $ 30 million lower for 2012 compared to 2011 . backlog backlog decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to lower orders on f-16 , c-5 , and c-130 programs , partially offset by higher orders on the f-35 program . backlog decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to lower orders on f-35 and c-130 programs , partially offset by higher orders on f-16 programs . trends we expect aeronautics 2019 net sales to increase in 2014 in the mid-single digit percentage range as compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in net sales from f-35 production contracts . operating profit is expected to increase slightly from 2013 , resulting in a slight decrease in operating margins between the years due to program mix . information systems & global solutions our is&gs business segment provides advanced technology systems and expertise , integrated information technology solutions , and management services across a broad spectrum of applications for civil , defense , intelligence , and other government customers . is&gs has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments . is&gs has been impacted by the continued downturn in federal information technology budgets . is&gs 2019 operating results included the following ( in millions ) : . 2013 compared to 2012 is&gs 2019 net sales decreased $ 479 million , or 5% ( 5 % ) , for 2013 compared to 2012 . the decrease was attributable to lower net sales of about $ 495 million due to decreased volume on various programs ( command and control programs for classified customers , ngi , and eram programs ) ; and approximately $ 320 million due to the completion of certain programs ( such as total information processing support services , the transportation worker identification credential ( twic ) , and odin ) . the decrease was partially offset by higher net sales of about $ 340 million due to the start-up of certain programs ( such as the disa gsm-o and the national science foundation antarctic support ) . is&gs 2019 operating profit decreased $ 49 million , or 6% ( 6 % ) , for 2013 compared to 2012 . the decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of about $ 55 million due to certain programs nearing the end of their lifecycles , partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $ 15 million due to the start-up of certain programs . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters , were comparable for 2013 compared to 2012 compared to 2011 is&gs 2019 net sales for 2012 decreased $ 535 million , or 6% ( 6 % ) , compared to 2011 . the decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately $ 485 million due to the substantial completion of various programs during 2011 ( primarily jtrs ; odin ; and u.k . census ) ; and about $ 255 million due to lower volume on numerous other programs ( primarily hanford; .

eastman notes to the audited consolidated financial statements stock option awards option awards are granted to non-employee directors on an annual basis and to employees who meet certain eligibility requirements . a single annual option grant is usually awarded to eligible employees in the fourth quarter of each year , if and when granted by the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors , and occasional individual grants are awarded to eligible employees throughout the year . option awards have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company's stock on the date of grant . the term of options is ten years with vesting periods that vary up to three years . vesting usually occurs ratably or at the end of the vesting period . sfas no . 123 ( r ) requires that stock option awards be valued at fair value determined by market price , if actively traded in a public market or , if not , calculated using an option pricing financial model . the fair value of the company's options cannot be determined by market value as they are not traded in an open market . accordingly , a financial pricing model is utilized to determine fair value . the company utilizes the black scholes merton ( ""bsm"" ) model which relies on certain assumptions to estimate an option's fair value . the weighted average assumptions used in the determination of fair value for stock options awarded in 2006 , 2005 and 2004 are provided in the table below: . prior to adoption of sfas no . 123 ( r ) , the company calculated the expected term of stock options of six years . effective with the fourth quarter 2005 annual option award , the company analyzed historical annual grant transactions over a ten year period comprising exercises , post-vesting cancellations and expirations to determine the expected term . the company expects to execute this analysis each year preceding the annual option grant to ensure that all assumptions based upon internal data reflect the most reasonable expectations for fair value determination . the weighted average expected term of 4.4 years for 2006 reflects the impact of this annual analysis and the weighting of option swap and reload grants which may have much shorter expected terms than new option grants . the volatility rate of grants is derived from historical company common stock volatility over the same time period as the expected term . the company uses a weekly high closing stock price based upon daily closing prices in the week . the volatility rate is derived by mathematical formula utilizing the weekly high closing price data . for the periods presented above , the expected dividend yield is derived by mathematical formula which uses the expected company annual dividend amount over the expected term divided by the fair market value of the company's common stock at the grant date . the average risk-free interest rate is derived from united states department of treasury published interest rates of daily yield curves for the same time period as the expected term . prior to adoption of sfas no . 123 ( r ) , the company did not estimate forfeitures and recognized them as they occurred for proforma disclosure of share-based compensation expense . with adoption of sfas no . 123 ( r ) , estimated forfeitures must be considered in recording share-based compensation expense . estimated forfeiture rates vary with each type of award affected by several factors , one of which is the varying composition and characteristics of the award participants . estimated forfeitures for the company's share-based awards historically range from 0.75 percent to 10.0 percent with the estimated forfeitures for options at 0.75 percent. .

f0b7 financial expectations 2013 we are cautious about the economic environment , but , assuming that industrial production grows approximately 3% ( 3 % ) as projected , volume should exceed 2013 levels . even with no volume growth , we expect earnings to exceed 2013 earnings , generated by core pricing gains , on-going network improvements and productivity initiatives . we expect that free cash flow for 2014 will be lower than 2013 as higher cash from operations will be more than offset by additional cash of approximately $ 400 million that will be used to pay income taxes that were previously deferred through bonus depreciation , increased capital spend and higher dividend payments . results of operations operating revenues millions 2013 2012 2011 % (  % ) change 2013 v 2012 % (  % ) change 2012 v 2011 . we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups . freight revenues vary with volume ( carloads ) and arc . changes in price , traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc . we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations , which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments . we recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination . we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them . other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries , revenues from our commuter rail operations , and accessorial revenues , which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage . we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations . freight revenues from five of our six commodity groups increased during 2013 compared to 2012 . revenue from agricultural products was down slightly compared to 2012 . arc increased 5% ( 5 % ) , driven by core pricing gains , shifts in business mix and an automotive logistics management arrangement . volume was essentially flat year over year as growth in automotives , frac sand , crude oil and domestic intermodal offset declines in coal , international intermodal and grain shipments . freight revenues from four of our six commodity groups increased during 2012 compared to 2011 . revenues from coal and agricultural products declined during the year . our franchise diversity allowed us to take advantage of growth from shale-related markets ( crude oil , frac sand and pipe ) and strong automotive manufacturing , which offset volume declines from coal and agricultural products . arc increased 7% ( 7 % ) , driven by core pricing gains and higher fuel cost recoveries . improved fuel recovery provisions and higher fuel prices , including the lag effect of our programs ( surcharges trail fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months ) , combined to increase revenues from fuel surcharges . our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of $ 2.6 billion , $ 2.6 billion , and $ 2.2 billion in 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively . fuel surcharge in 2013 was essentially flat versus 2012 as lower fuel price offset improved fuel recovery provisions and the lag effect of our programs ( surcharges trail fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months ) . rising fuel prices and more shipments subject to fuel surcharges drove the increase from 2011 to 2012 . in 2013 , other revenue increased from 2012 due primarily to miscellaneous contract revenue and higher revenues at our subsidiaries that broker intermodal and automotive services . in 2012 , other revenues increased from 2011 due primarily to higher revenues at our subsidiaries that broker intermodal and automotive services . assessorial revenues also increased in 2012 due to container revenue related to an increase in intermodal shipments. .

shipments to the domestic market increased , but export shipments declined . average sales price realizations decreased , primarily in the domestic market . input costs were lower , mainly for energy . planned maintenance downtime costs were $ 12 million higher in 2015 . operating profits in 2014 were negatively impacted by costs associated with the shutdown of our courtland , alabama mill . entering the first quarter of 2016 , sales volumes are expected to be up slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 . average sales margins should be about flat reflecting lower average sales price realizations offset by a more favorable product mix . input costs are expected to be stable . planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be about $ 14 million lower with an outage

Step 2: Calculate the average berths per ship for 2008: 108,000 berths / 102 ships = 1,058.82 berths per ship.
Step 3: Calculate the average berths per ship for 2012: 156,000 berths / 117 ships = 1,333.33 berths per ship.

in 2004 , of which 65000 tons related to lack-of-orders . printing papers in millions 2005 2004 2003 . uncoated papers sales totaled $ 4.8 billion in 2005 compared with $ 5.0 billion in 2004 and 2003 . sales price realizations in the united states averaged 4.4% ( 4.4 % ) higher in 2005 than in 2004 , and 4.6% ( 4.6 % ) higher than 2003 . favorable pricing momentum which began in 2004 carried over into the beginning of 2005 . demand , however , began to weaken across all grades as the year progressed , resulting in lower price realizations in the second and third quarters . however , prices stabilized as the year ended . total shipments for the year were 7.2% ( 7.2 % ) lower than in 2004 and 4.2% ( 4.2 % ) lower than in 2003 . to continue matching our productive capacity with customer demand , the business announced the perma- nent closure of three uncoated freesheet machines and took significant lack-of-order downtime during the period . demand showed some improvement toward the end of the year , bolstered by the introduction our new line of vision innovation paper products ( vip technologiestm ) , with improved brightness and white- ness . mill operations were favorable compared to last year , and the rebuild of the no . 1 machine at the east- over , south carolina mill was completed as planned in the fourth quarter . however , the favorable impacts of improved mill operations and lower overhead costs were more than offset by record high input costs for energy and wood and higher transportation costs compared to 2004 . the earnings decline in 2005 compared with 2003 was principally due to lower shipments , higher down- time and increased costs for wood , energy and trans- portation , partially offset by lower overhead costs and favorable mill operations .

slightly , up 1% ( 1 % ) in 2005 com- pared with 2004 and 5% ( 5 % ) compared to 2003 . earnings were lower than in 2004 , reflecting higher wood and energy costs and a compression of margins due to un- favorable foreign currency exchange movements . earn- ings were also adversely affected by downtime related to the rebuild of three paper machines during the year . coated papers sales in the united states were $ 1.6 bil- lion in 2005 , compared with $ 1.4 billion in 2004 and $ 1.3 billion in 2003 . the business reported an operating profit in 2005 versus a small operating loss in 2004 . the earnings improvement was driven by higher average sales prices and improved mill operations . price realiza- tions in 2005 averaged 13% ( 13 % ) higher than 2004 . higher input costs for raw materials and energy partially offset the benefits from improved prices and operations . sales volumes were about 1% ( 1 % ) lower in 2005 versus 2004 . market pulp sales from our u.s . and european facilities totaled $ 757 million in 2005 compared with $ 661 mil- lion and $ 571 million in 2004 and 2003 , respectively . operating profits in 2005 were up 86% ( 86 % ) from 2004 . an operating loss had been reported in 2003 . higher aver- age prices and sales volumes , lower overhead costs and improved mill operations in 2005 more than offset in- creases in raw material , energy and chemical costs . u.s . softwood and hardwood pulp prices improved through the 2005 first and second quarters , then declined during the third quarter , but recovered somewhat toward year end . softwood pulp prices ended the year about 2% ( 2 % ) lower than 2004 , but were 15% ( 15 % ) higher than 2003 , while hardwood pulp prices ended the year about 15% ( 15 % ) higher than 2004 and 10% ( 10 % ) higher than 2003 . u.s . pulp sales volumes were 12% ( 12 % ) higher than in 2004 and 19% ( 19 % ) higher than in 2003 , reflecting increased global demand . euro- pean pulp volumes increased 15% ( 15 % )

684 million in 2005 com- pared with $ 592 million in 2004 and $ 540 million in 2003 . sales volumes for uncoated freesheet paper , coated paper and wood chips were down from 2004 , but average price realizations improved for exported un- coated freesheet and coated groundwood paper grades . favorable currency translation , as yearly average real exchange rates versus the u.s . dollar were 17% ( 17 % ) higher in 2005 than in 2004 , positively impacted reported sales in u.s . dollars . average sales prices for domestic un- coated paper declined 4% ( 4 % ) in local currency versus 2004 , while domestic coated paper prices were down 3% ( 3 % ) . operating profits in 2005 were down 9% ( 9 % ) from 2004 , but were up 2% ( 2 % ) from 2003 . earnings in 2005 were neg- atively impacted by a

at december 31 , 2014 , total future minimum commitments under existing non-cancelable operating leases and purchase obligations were as follows: . ( a ) includes $ 2.3 billion relating to fiber supply agreements entered into at the time of the company 2019s 2006 transformation plan forestland sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of weyerhaeuser company 2019s containerboard , packaging and recycling business . rent expense was $ 154 million , $ 168 million and $ 185 million for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively . guarantees in connection with sales of businesses , property , equipment , forestlands and other assets , international paper commonly makes representations and warranties relating to such businesses or assets , and may agree to indemnify buyers with respect to tax and environmental liabilities , breaches of representations and warranties , and other matters . where liabilities for such matters are determined to be probable and subject to reasonable estimation , accrued liabilities are recorded at the time of sale as a cost of the transaction . environmental proceedings cercla and state actions international paper has been named as a potentially responsible party in environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws , including the comprehensive environmental response , compensation and liability act ( cercla ) . many of these proceedings involve the cleanup of hazardous substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources . while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws , as a practical matter , liability for cercla cleanups is typically allocated among the many potential responsible parties . remedial costs are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they become probable and reasonably estimable . international paper has estimated the probable liability associated with these matters to be approximately $ 95 million in the aggregate as of december 31 , 2014 . cass lake : one of the matters referenced above is a closed wood treating facility located in cass lake , minnesota . during 2009 , in connection with an environmental site remediation action under cercla , international paper submitted to the epa a remediation feasibility study . in june 2011 , the epa selected and published a proposed soil remedy at the site with an estimated cost of $ 46 million . the overall remediation reserve for the site is currently $ 50 million to address the selection of an alternative for the soil remediation component of the overall site remedy . in october 2011 , the epa released a public statement indicating that the final soil remedy decision would be delayed . in the unlikely event that the epa changes its proposed soil remedy and approves instead a more expensive clean- up alternative , the remediation costs could be material , and significantly higher than amounts currently recorded . in october 2012 , the natural resource trustees for this site provided notice to international paper and other potentially responsible parties of their intent to perform a natural resource damage assessment . it is premature to predict the outcome of the assessment or to estimate a loss or range of loss , if any , which may be incurred . other remediation costs in addition to the above matters , other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of hazardous substances at the company 2019s current , closed or formerly-owned facilities , and recorded as liabilities in the balance sheet , totaled approximately $ 41 million as of december 31 , 2014 . other than as described above , completion of required remedial actions is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements . legal proceedings environmental kalamazoo river : the company is a potentially responsible party with respect to the allied paper , inc./ portage creek/kalamazoo river superfund site ( kalamazoo river superfund site ) in michigan . the epa asserts that the site is contaminated primarily by pcbs as a result of discharges from various paper mills located along the kalamazoo river , including a paper mill formerly owned by st . regis paper company ( st . regis ) . the company is a successor in interest to st . regis . although the company has not received any orders from the epa , in december 2014 , the epa sent the company a letter demanding payment of $ 19 million to reimburse the epa for costs associated with a time critical removal action of pcb contaminated sediments from a portion of the site . the company 2019s cercla liability has not been finally determined with respect to this or any other portion of the site and we have declined to reimburse the epa at this time . as noted below , the company is involved in allocation/ apportionment litigation with regard to the site . accordingly , it is premature to estimate a loss or range of loss with respect to this site . the company was named as a defendant by georgia- pacific consumer products lp , fort james corporation and georgia pacific llc in a contribution and cost recovery action for alleged pollution at the site . the suit .

Step 1: Identify the reduction to cost of sales for each year. From the table, we see that the reduction to cost of sales was $5,572 in 2013 and $24,087 in 2012. There was an increase to cost of sales of $24,708 in 2011.
Step 2: Calculate the total reduction from 2011 to 2013. This is done by subtracting the increase in 2011 from the sum of the reductions in 2012 and 2013. 
Total reduction = ($5,572 + $24,087) - $24,708 = $4,951

royal caribbean cruises ltd . 79 notes to the consolidated financial statements in 2012 , we determined the implied fair value of good- will for the pullmantur reporting unit was $ 145.5 mil- lion and recognized an impairment charge of $ 319.2 million based on a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model further discussed below . this impair- ment charge was recognized in earnings during the fourth quarter of 2012 and is reported within impair- ment of pullmantur related assets within our consoli- dated statements of comprehensive income ( loss ) . during the fourth quarter of 2014 , we performed a qualitative assessment of whether it was more-likely- than-not that our royal caribbean international reporting unit 2019s fair value was less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impair- ment test . the qualitative analysis included assessing the impact of certain factors such as general economic conditions , limitations on accessing capital , changes in forecasted operating results , changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates . based on our qualitative assessment , we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus , we did not pro- ceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test . no indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting unit 2019s fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin , its financial performance has been solid in the face of mixed economic environments and forecasts of operating results generated by the reporting unit appear suffi- cient to support its carrying value . we also performed our annual impairment review of goodwill for pullmantur 2019s reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2014 . we did not perform a quali- tative assessment but instead proceeded directly to the two-step goodwill impairment test . we estimated the fair value of the pullmantur reporting unit using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model . the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results , weighted- average cost of capital , and terminal value . signifi- cantly impacting these assumptions are the transfer of vessels from our other cruise brands to pullmantur . the discounted cash flow model used our 2015 pro- jected operating results as a base . to that base , we added future years 2019 cash flows assuming multiple rev- enue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact of different global economic environments beyond 2015 on pullmantur 2019s reporting unit . we assigned a probability to each revenue and expense scenario . we discounted the projected cash flows using rates specific to pullmantur 2019s reporting unit based on its weighted-average cost of capital . based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows , we deter- mined the fair value of the pullmantur reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 52% ( 52 % ) resulting in no impairment to pullmantur 2019s goodwill . pullmantur is a brand targeted primarily at the spanish , portuguese and latin american markets , with an increasing focus on latin america . the persistent economic instability in these markets has created sig- nificant uncertainties in forecasting operating results and future cash flows used in our impairment analyses . we continue to monitor economic events in these markets for their potential impact on pullmantur 2019s business and valuation . further , the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues , operating costs , marketing , sell- ing and administrative expenses , interest rates , ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry 2019s competitive environment and general economic and business conditions , among other factors . if there are changes to the projected future cash flows used in the impairment analyses , especially in net yields or if certain transfers of vessels from our other cruise brands to the pullmantur fleet do not take place , it is possible that an impairment charge of pullmantur 2019s reporting unit 2019s goodwill may be required . of these factors , the planned transfers of vessels to the pullmantur fleet is most significant to the projected future cash flows . if the transfers do not occur , we will likely fail step one of the impairment test . note 4 . intangible assets intangible assets are reported in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and consist of the follow- ing ( in thousands ) : . during the fourth quarter of 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , we performed the annual impairment review of pullmantur 2019s trademarks and trade names using a discounted cash flow model and the relief-from-royalty method to compare the fair value of these indefinite-lived intan- gible assets to its carrying value . the royalty rate used is based on comparable royalty agreements in the tourism and hospitality industry . we used a dis- count rate comparable to the rate used in valuing the pullmantur reporting unit in our goodwill impairment test . based on the results of our testing , we did not .

Step 1: Identify the FX Impact on Multi-asset value in 2014 from the table. The FX Impact is $(13,326) million.
Step 2: Identify the Multi-asset value at the end of 2014 from the table. The Multi-asset value is $377,837 million.
Step 3: Calculate the percentage change due to FX Impact. The formula for percent change is ((new - old)/old) * 100. In this case, the ""new"" value is the Multi-asset value at the end of 2014, the ""old"" value is the Multi-asset value at the end of 2014 plus the FX Impact (because the FX Impact reduced the Multi-asset value), and the difference between the new and old values is the FX Impact. So, the percent change due to FX Impact is ((377,837 - (377,837 + 13,326)) / (377,837 + 13,326)) * 100.

long-term product offerings include active and index strategies . our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile . we offer two types of active strategies : those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction . in contrast , index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index , generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index . index strategies include both our non-etf index products and ishares etfs . althoughmany clients use both active and index strategies , the application of these strategies may differ . for example , clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class . in addition , institutional non-etf index assignments tend to be very large ( multi-billion dollars ) and typically reflect low fee rates . this has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on blackrock 2019s revenues and earnings . equity year-end 2014 equity aum of $ 2.451 trillion increased by $ 133.4 billion , or 6% ( 6 % ) , from the end of 2013 due to net new business of $ 52.4 billion and net market appreciation and foreign exchange movements of $ 81.0 billion . net inflows were driven by $ 59.6 billion and $ 17.7 billion into ishares and non-etf index accounts , respectively . index inflows were offset by active net outflows of $ 24.9 billion , with outflows of $ 18.0 billion and $ 6.9 billion from fundamental and scientific active equity products , respectively . blackrock 2019s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in aummix . approximately half of blackrock 2019s equity aum is tied to international markets , including emerging markets , which tend to have higher fee rates than similar u.s . equity strategies . accordingly , fluctuations in international equity markets , which do not consistently move in tandemwith u.s . markets , may have a greater impact on blackrock 2019s effective equity fee rates and revenues . fixed income fixed income aum ended 2014 at $ 1.394 trillion , increasing $ 151.5 billion , or 12% ( 12 % ) , from december 31 , 2013 . the increase in aum reflected $ 96.4 billion in net new business and $ 55.1 billion in net market appreciation and foreign exchange movements . in 2014 , net new business was diversified across fixed income offerings , with strong flows into our unconstrained , total return and high yield products . flagship funds in these product areas include our unconstrained strategic income opportunities and fixed income global opportunities funds , with net inflows of $ 13.3 billion and $ 4.2 billion , respectively ; our total return fund with net inflows of $ 2.1 billion ; and our high yield bond fund with net inflows of $ 2.1 billion . fixed income net inflows were positive across investment styles , with ishares , non- etf index , and active net inflows of $ 40.0 billion , $ 28.7 billion and $ 27.7 billion , respectively . multi-asset class blackrock 2019s multi-asset class teammanages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities , currencies , bonds and commodities , and our extensive risk management capabilities . investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays . component changes in multi-asset class aum for 2014 are presented below . ( in millions ) december 31 , 2013 net inflows ( outflows ) market change fx impact december 31 , 2014 . flows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $ 15.1 billion , or 52% ( 52 % ) , of net inflows coming from institutional clients . defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows , and contributed $ 12.8 billion to institutional multi- asset class net new business in 2014 , primarily into target date and target risk product offerings . retail net inflows of $ 13.4 billion were driven by particular demand for our multi- asset income fund , which raised $ 6.3 billion in 2014 . the company 2019s multi-asset strategies include the following : 2022 asset allocation and balanced products represented 48% ( 48 % ) of multi-asset class aum at year-end , with growth in aum driven by net new business of $ 18.4 billion . these strategies combine equity , fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget . in certain cases , these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification , derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions . flagship products in this category include our global allocation andmulti-asset income suites . 2022 target date and target risk products grew 10% ( 10 % ) organically in 2014 . institutional investors represented 90% ( 90 % ) of target date and target risk aum , with defined contribution plans accounting for over 80% ( 80 % ) of aum . the remaining 10% ( 10 % ) of target date and target risk aum consisted of retail client investments . flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our lifepath and lifepath retirement income ae offerings . lifepath products utilize a proprietary asset allocation model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor 2019s expected retirement timing . 2022 fiduciary management services are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain blackrock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of planmanagement . these customized services require strong partnership with the clients 2019 investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives. .

reinvested for continued use in foreign operations . if the total undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted , a significant amount of the additional tax would be offset by the allowable foreign tax credits . it is not practical for us to determine the additional tax of remitting these earnings . in september 2007 , we reached a settlement with the united states department of justice to resolve an investigation into financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting orthopaedic surgeons . under the terms of the settlement , we paid a civil settlement amount of $ 169.5 million and we recorded an expense in that amount . at the time , no tax benefit was recorded related to the settlement expense due to the uncertainty as to the tax treatment . during the third quarter of 2008 , we reached an agreement with the u.s . internal revenue service ( irs ) confirming the deductibility of a portion of the settlement payment . as a result , during 2008 we recorded a current tax benefit of $ 31.7 million . in june 2006 , the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) issued interpretation no . 48 , accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 2013 an interpretation of fasb statement no . 109 , accounting for income taxes ( fin 48 ) . fin 48 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements . under fin 48 , we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities , based on the technical merits of the position . the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement . fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition , classification , interest and penalties on income taxes , accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures . we adopted fin 48 on january 1 , 2007 . prior to the adoption of fin 48 we had a long term tax liability for expected settlement of various federal , state and foreign income tax liabilities that was reflected net of the corollary tax impact of these expected settlements of $ 102.1 million , as well as a separate accrued interest liability of $ 1.7 million . as a result of the adoption of fin 48 , we are required to present the different components of such liability on a gross basis versus the historical net presentation . the adoption resulted in the financial statement liability for unrecognized tax benefits decreasing by $ 6.4 million as of january 1 , 2007 . the adoption resulted in this decrease in the liability as well as a reduction to retained earnings of $ 4.8 million , a reduction in goodwill of $ 61.4 million , the establishment of a tax receivable of $ 58.2 million , which was recorded in other current and non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheet , and an increase in an interest/penalty payable of $ 7.9 million , all as of january 1 , 2007 . therefore , after the adoption of fin 48 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is $ 95.7 million as of january 1 , 2007 . as of december 31 , 2008 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is $ 129.5 million . of this amount , $ 45.5 million would impact our effective tax rate if recognized . $ 38.2 million of the $ 129.5 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions of acquired entities taken prior to their acquisition by us . under fas 141 ( r ) , if these liabilities are settled for different amounts , they will affect the income tax expense in the period of reversal or settlement . the following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits ( in millions ) : . we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of earnings , which is consistent with the recognition of these items in prior reporting periods . as of december 31 , 2007 , we recorded a liability of $ 19.6 million for accrued interest and penalties , of which $ 14.7 million would impact our effective tax rate , if recognized . the amount of this liability is $ 22.9 million as of december 31 , 2008 . of this amount , $ 17.1 million would impact our effective tax rate , if recognized . we expect that the amount of tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months ; however , we do not expect these changes will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position . the u.s . federal statute of limitations remains open for the year 2003 and onward . the u.s . federal returns for years 2003 and 2004 are currently under examination by the irs . on july 15 , 2008 , the irs issued its examination report . we filed a formal protest on august 15 , 2008 and requested a conference with the appeals office regarding disputed issues . although the appeals process could take several years , we do not anticipate resolution of the audit will result in any significant impact on our results of operations , financial position or cash flows . in addition , for the 1999 tax year of centerpulse , which we acquired in october 2003 , one issue remains in dispute . state income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of 3 to 5 years after filing of the respective return . the state impact of any federal changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the states . we have various state income tax returns in the process of examination , administrative appeals or litigation . it is z i m m e r h o l d i n g s , i n c . 2 0 0 8 f o r m 1 0 - k a n n u a l r e p o r t notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) %%transmsg*** transmitting job : c48761 pcn : 057000000 ***%%pcmsg|57 |00010|yes|no|02/24/2009 06:10|0|0|page is valid , no graphics -- color : d| .

management 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( continued ) funding deposits : we provide products and services including custody , accounting , administration , daily pricing , foreign exchange services , cash management , financial asset management , securities finance and investment advisory services . as a provider of these products and services , we generate client deposits , which have generally provided a stable , low-cost source of funds . as a global custodian , clients place deposits with state street entities in various currencies . we invest these client deposits in a combination of investment securities and short- duration financial instruments whose mix is determined by the characteristics of the deposits . for the past several years , we have experienced higher client deposit inflows toward the end of the quarter or the end of the year . as a result , we believe average client deposit balances are more reflective of ongoing funding than period-end balances . table 33 : client deposits average balance december 31 , year ended december 31 . client deposits ( 1 ) $ 195276 $ 182268 $ 167470 $ 143043 ( 1 ) balance as of december 31 , 2014 excluded term wholesale certificates of deposit , or cds , of $ 13.76 billion ; average balances for the year ended december 31 , 2014 and 2013 excluded average cds of $ 6.87 billion and $ 2.50 billion , respectively . short-term funding : our corporate commercial paper program , under which we can issue up to $ 3.0 billion of commercial paper with original maturities of up to 270 days from the date of issuance , had $ 2.48 billion and $ 1.82 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively . our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy . these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets , but more importantly , they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales . in addition , our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors . as discussed earlier under 201casset liquidity , 201d state street bank's membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral . short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase . these transactions are short-term in nature , generally overnight , and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities . these balances were $ 8.93 billion and $ 7.95 billion as of december 31 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively . state street bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of cad $ 800 million , or approximately $ 690 million as of december 31 , 2014 , to support its canadian securities processing operations . the line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice . as of december 31 , 2014 , there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit . long-term funding : as of december 31 , 2014 , state street bank had board authority to issue unsecured senior debt securities from time to time , provided that the aggregate principal amount of such unsecured senior debt outstanding at any one time does not exceed $ 5 billion . as of december 31 , 2014 , $ 4.1 billion was available for issuance pursuant to this authority . as of december 31 , 2014 , state street bank also had board authority to issue an additional $ 500 million of subordinated debt . we maintain an effective universal shelf registration that allows for the public offering and sale of debt securities , capital securities , common stock , depositary shares and preferred stock , and warrants to purchase such securities , including any shares into which the preferred stock and depositary shares may be convertible , or any combination thereof . we have issued in the past , and we may issue in the future , securities pursuant to our shelf registration . the issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions , funding needs and other factors . agency credit ratings our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment-grade ratings as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies . factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings ; relative market position ; strong risk management ; strong capital ratios ; diverse liquidity sources , including the global capital markets and client deposits ; strong liquidity monitoring procedures ; and preparedness for current or future regulatory developments . high ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors , increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products , serve markets , and engage in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings . a downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital .

available-for-sale securities and amortization of prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses in actuarial assumptions . treasury stock 2013 we account for repurchases of common stock under the cost method and present treasury stock as a reduction of stockholders 2019 equity . we reissue common stock held in treasury only for limited purposes . noncontrolling interest 2013 in 2011 , we made an investment in a company in which we acquired a controlling financial interest , but not 100 percent of the equity . in 2013 , we purchased additional shares of the company from the minority shareholders . further information related to the noncontrolling interests of that investment has not been provided as it is not significant to our consolidated financial statements . accounting pronouncements 2013 effective january 1 , 2013 , we adopted the fasb 2019s accounting standard updates ( asus ) requiring reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income ( oci ) and balance sheet offsetting between derivative assets and liabilities . these asus only change financial statement disclosure requirements and therefore do not impact our financial position , results of operations or cash flows . see note 12 for disclosures relating to oci . see note 13 for disclosures relating to balance sheet offsetting . there are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that are expected to have a material effect on our financial position , results of operations or cash flows . 3 . share-based compensation our share-based payments primarily consist of stock options , restricted stock , restricted stock units ( rsus ) , and an employee stock purchase plan . share-based compensation expense is as follows ( in millions ) : . share-based compensation cost capitalized as part of inventory for the years ended december 31 , 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $ 4.1 million , $ 6.1 million , and $ 8.8 million , respectively . as of december 31 , 2013 and 2012 , approximately $ 2.4 million and $ 3.3 million of capitalized costs remained in finished goods inventory . stock options we had two equity compensation plans in effect at december 31 , 2013 : the 2009 stock incentive plan ( 2009 plan ) and the stock plan for non-employee directors . the 2009 plan succeeded the 2006 stock incentive plan ( 2006 plan ) and the teamshare stock option plan ( teamshare plan ) . no further awards have been granted under the 2006 plan or under the teamshare plan since may 2009 , and shares remaining available for grant under those plans have been merged into the 2009 plan . vested and unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock and rsus previously granted under the 2006 plan , the teamshare plan and another prior plan , the 2001 stock incentive plan , remained outstanding as of december 31 , 2013 . we have reserved the maximum number of shares of common stock available for award under the terms of each of these plans . we have registered 57.9 million shares of common stock under these plans . the 2009 plan provides for the grant of nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options , long-term performance awards in the form of performance shares or units , restricted stock , rsus and stock appreciation rights . the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors determines the grant date for annual grants under our equity compensation plans . the date for annual grants under the 2009 plan to our executive officers is expected to occur in the first quarter of each year following the earnings announcements for the previous quarter and full year . the stock plan for non-employee directors provides for awards of stock options , restricted stock and rsus to non-employee directors . it has been our practice to issue shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options from previously unissued shares , except in limited circumstances where they are issued from treasury stock . the total number of awards which may be granted in a given year and/or over the life of the plan under each of our equity compensation plans is limited . at december 31 , 2013 , an aggregate of 10.4 million shares were available for future grants and awards under these plans . stock options granted to date under our plans generally vest over four years and generally have a maximum contractual life of 10 years . as established under our equity compensation plans , vesting may accelerate upon retirement after the first anniversary date of the award if certain criteria are met . we recognize expense related to stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period , less awards expected to be forfeited using estimated forfeiture rates . due to the accelerated retirement provisions , the requisite service period of our stock options range from one to four years . stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant , except in limited circumstances where local law may dictate otherwise. .

sources of liquidity primary sources of liquidity for citigroup and its principal subsidiaries include : 2022 deposits ; 2022 collateralized financing transactions ; 2022 senior and subordinated debt ; 2022 commercial paper ; 2022 trust preferred and preferred securities ; and 2022 purchased/wholesale funds . citigroup 2019s funding sources are diversified across funding types and geography , a benefit of its global franchise . funding for citigroup and its major operating subsidiaries includes a geographically diverse retail and corporate deposit base of $ 774.2 billion . these deposits are diversified across products and regions , with approximately two-thirds of them outside of the u.s . this diversification provides the company with an important , stable and low-cost source of funding . a significant portion of these deposits has been , and is expected to be , long-term and stable , and are considered to be core . there are qualitative as well as quantitative assessments that determine the company 2019s calculation of core deposits . the first step in this process is a qualitative assessment of the deposits . for example , as a result of the company 2019s qualitative analysis certain deposits with wholesale funding characteristics are excluded from consideration as core . deposits that qualify under the company 2019s qualitative assessments are then subjected to quantitative analysis . excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and the sale of our retail banking operations in germany during the year ending december 31 , 2008 , the company 2019s deposit base remained stable . on a volume basis , deposit increases were noted in transaction services , u.s . retail banking and smith barney . this was partially offset by the company 2019s decision to reduce deposits considered wholesale funding , consistent with the company 2019s de-leveraging efforts , and declines in international consumer banking and the private bank . citigroup and its subsidiaries have historically had a significant presence in the global capital markets . the company 2019s capital markets funding activities have been primarily undertaken by two legal entities : ( i ) citigroup inc. , which issues long-term debt , medium-term notes , trust preferred securities , and preferred and common stock ; and ( ii ) citigroup funding inc . ( cfi ) , a first-tier subsidiary of citigroup , which issues commercial paper , medium-term notes and structured equity-linked and credit-linked notes , all of which are guaranteed by citigroup . other significant elements of long- term debt on the consolidated balance sheet include collateralized advances from the federal home loan bank system , long-term debt related to the consolidation of icg 2019s structured investment vehicles , asset-backed outstandings , and certain borrowings of foreign subsidiaries . each of citigroup 2019s major operating subsidiaries finances its operations on a basis consistent with its capitalization , regulatory structure and the environment in which it operates . particular attention is paid to those businesses that for tax , sovereign risk , or regulatory reasons cannot be freely and readily funded in the international markets . citigroup 2019s borrowings have historically been diversified by geography , investor , instrument and currency . decisions regarding the ultimate currency and interest rate profile of liquidity generated through these borrowings can be separated from the actual issuance through the use of derivative instruments . citigroup is a provider of liquidity facilities to the commercial paper programs of the two primary credit card securitization trusts with which it transacts . citigroup may also provide other types of support to the trusts . as a result of the recent economic downturn , its impact on the cashflows of the trusts , and in response to credit rating agency reviews of the trusts , the company increased the credit enhancement in the omni trust , and plans to provide additional enhancement to the master trust ( see note 23 to consolidated financial statements on page 175 for a further discussion ) . this support preserves investor sponsorship of our card securitization franchise , an important source of liquidity . banking subsidiaries there are various legal limitations on the ability of citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions to extend credit , pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to citigroup and its non-bank subsidiaries . the approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency , in the case of national banks , or the office of thrift supervision , in the case of federal savings banks , is required if total dividends declared in any calendar year exceed amounts specified by the applicable agency 2019s regulations . state-chartered depository institutions are subject to dividend limitations imposed by applicable state law . in determining the declaration of dividends , each depository institution must also consider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements , as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings . non-banking subsidiaries citigroup also receives dividends from its non-bank subsidiaries . these non-bank subsidiaries are generally not subject to regulatory restrictions on dividends . however , as discussed in 201ccapital resources and liquidity 201d on page 94 , the ability of cgmhi to declare dividends can be restricted by capital considerations of its broker-dealer subsidiaries . cgmhi 2019s consolidated balance sheet is liquid , with the vast majority of its assets consisting of marketable securities and collateralized short-term financing agreements arising from securities transactions . cgmhi monitors and evaluates the adequacy of its capital and borrowing base on a daily basis to maintain liquidity and to ensure that its capital base supports the regulatory capital requirements of its subsidiaries . some of citigroup 2019s non-bank subsidiaries , including cgmhi , have credit facilities with citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions , including citibank , n.a . borrowings under these facilities must be secured in accordance with section 23a of the federal reserve act . there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which a bank holding company and certain of its non-bank subsidiaries can borrow or obtain credit from citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions or engage in certain other transactions with them . in general , these restrictions require that transactions be on arm 2019s length terms and be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral . see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements on page 169 . at december 31 , 2008 , long-term debt and commercial paper outstanding for citigroup , cgmhi , cfi and citigroup 2019s subsidiaries were as follows : in billions of dollars citigroup parent company cgmhi ( 2 ) citigroup funding inc . ( 2 ) citigroup subsidiaries long-term debt $ 192.3 $ 20.6 $ 37.4 $ 109.3 ( 1 ) . ( 1 ) at december 31 , 2008 , approximately $ 67.4 billion relates to collateralized advances from the federal home loan bank . ( 2 ) citigroup inc . guarantees all of cfi 2019s debt and cgmhi 2019s publicly issued securities. .

Step 1: The total debt in 2007 is $7,215 million.
Step 2: The company has a committed $3.0 billion revolving credit facility.
Step 3: If the company fully draws its available revolver, the total debt would increase by the amount of the revolver.
Step 4: Convert the revolver amount to millions (1 billion = 1,000 million), so the revolver is $3,000 million.

2022 international . in general , our international markets are less advanced with respect to the current technologies deployed for wireless services . as a result , demand for our communications sites is driven by continued voice network investments , new market entrants and initial 3g data network deployments . for example , in india , nationwide voice networks continue to be deployed as wireless service providers are beginning their initial investments in 3g data networks , as a result of recent spectrum auctions . in mexico and brazil , where nationwide voice networks have been deployed , some incumbent wireless service providers continue to invest in their 3g data networks , and recent spectrum auctions have enabled other incumbent wireless service providers and new market entrants to begin their initial investments in 3g data networks . in markets such as chile and peru , recent spectrum auctions have attracted new market entrants , who are expected to begin their investment in deploying nationwide voice and 3g data networks . we believe demand for our tower sites will continue in our international markets as wireless service providers seek to remain competitive by increasing the coverage of their networks while also investing in next generation data networks . rental and management operations new site revenue growth . during the year ended december 31 , 2010 , we grew our portfolio of communications sites through acquisitions and construction activities , including the acquisition and construction of approximately 7800 sites . we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications site portfolios , both domestically and internationally , that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing portfolio. . ( 1 ) the majority of sites acquired or constructed internationally during 2010 and 2009 were in india and our newly launched operations in chile , colombia and peru . network development services segment revenue growth . as we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations , we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues . through our network development services segment , we offer tower-related services , including site acquisition , zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services , which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites . rental and management operations expenses . our rental and management operations expenses include our direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent , property taxes , repairs and maintenance and utilities . these segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate level selling , general , administrative and development expenses , which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling , general , administrative and development expense . in general , our rental and management segment level selling , general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year . as a result , leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow . in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on materially expanding our site footprint , we may incur additional segment level selling , general and administrative expenses as we increase our presence in these areas . our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities . reit election . as we review our tax strategy and assess the utilization of our federal and state nols , we are actively considering an election to a reit for u.s . federal and , where applicable , state income tax purposes . we may make the determination to elect reit status for the taxable year beginning january 1 , 2012 , as early as the second half of 2011 , subject to the approval of our board of directors , although there is no certainty as to the timing of a reit election or whether we will make a reit election at all. .
