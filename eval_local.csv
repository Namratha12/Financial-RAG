The table does not provide any relevant data regarding the net sales for the years 2000 and 2001. However, the narrative context mentions that revenues increased by 24% from 2000 to 2001. It's important to note that revenues and net sales are often used interchangeably in financial reporting, but without explicit confirmation, we cannot assume they are the same in this case.

26 | 2009 annual report in fiscal 2008 , revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased 14% ( 14 % ) from fiscal 2007 . all revenue components within the segment experienced growth during fiscal 2008 . license revenue generated the largest dollar growth in revenue as episys ae , our flagship core processing system aimed at larger credit unions , experienced strong sales throughout the year . support and service revenue , which is the largest component of total revenues for the credit union segment , experienced 34 percent growth in eft support and 10 percent growth in in-house support . gross profit in this business segment increased $ 9344 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 , due primarily to the increase in license revenue , which carries the highest margins . liquidity and capital resources we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements . we expect this trend to continue in the future . the company 2019s cash and cash equivalents increased to $ 118251 at june 30 , 2009 from $ 65565 at june 30 , 2008 . the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows : 2009 2008 2007 . year ended june 30 , cash provided by operations increased $ 25587 to $ 206588 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2009 as compared to $ 181001 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2008 . this increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in receivables compared to the same period a year ago of $ 21214 . this decrease is largely the result of fiscal 2010 annual software maintenance billings being provided to customers earlier than in the prior year , which allowed more cash to be collected before the end of the fiscal year than in previous years . further , we collected more cash overall related to revenues that will be recognized in subsequent periods in the current year than in fiscal 2008 . cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2009 was $ 59227 and includes $ 3027 in contingent consideration paid on prior years 2019 acquisitions . cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2008 was $ 102148 and includes payments for acquisitions of $ 48109 , plus $ 1215 in contingent consideration paid on prior years 2019 acquisitions . capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 were $ 31562 compared to $ 31105 for fiscal 2008 . cash used for software development in fiscal 2009 was $ 24684 compared to $ 23736 during the prior year . net cash used in financing activities for the current fiscal year was $ 94675 and includes the repurchase of 3106 shares of our common stock for $ 58405 , the payment of dividends of $ 26903 and $ 13489 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities . cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 3773 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock ( through the employee stock purchase plan ) and $ 348 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . during fiscal 2008 , net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year was $ 101905 and includes the repurchase of 4200 shares of our common stock for $ 100996 , the payment of dividends of $ 24683 and $ 429 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities . cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 20394 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock and $ 3809 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . beginning during fiscal 2008 , us financial markets and many of the largest us financial institutions have been shaken by negative developments in the home mortgage industry and the mortgage markets , and particularly the markets for subprime mortgage-backed securities . since that time , these and other such developments have resulted in a broad , global economic downturn . while we , as is the case with most companies , have experienced the effects of this downturn , we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts , and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity will be minimized by cash generated by recurring sources of revenue and due to our access to available lines of credit. .

26 | 2009 annual report in fiscal 2008 , revenues in the credit union systems and services business segment increased 14% ( 14 % ) from fiscal 2007 . all revenue components within the segment experienced growth during fiscal 2008 . license revenue generated the largest dollar growth in revenue as episys ae , our flagship core processing system aimed at larger credit unions , experienced strong sales throughout the year . support and service revenue , which is the largest component of total revenues for the credit union segment , experienced 34 percent growth in eft support and 10 percent growth in in-house support . gross profit in this business segment increased $ 9344 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 , due primarily to the increase in license revenue , which carries the highest margins . liquidity and capital resources we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements . we expect this trend to continue in the future . the company 2019s cash and cash equivalents increased to $ 118251 at june 30 , 2009 from $ 65565 at june 30 , 2008 . the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows : 2009 2008 2007 . year ended june 30 , cash provided by operations increased $ 25587 to $ 206588 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2009 as compared to $ 181001 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2008 . this increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in receivables compared to the same period a year ago of $ 21214 . this decrease is largely the result of fiscal 2010 annual software maintenance billings being provided to customers earlier than in the prior year , which allowed more cash to be collected before the end of the fiscal year than in previous years . further , we collected more cash overall related to revenues that will be recognized in subsequent periods in the current year than in fiscal 2008 . cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2009 was $ 59227 and includes $ 3027 in contingent consideration paid on prior years 2019 acquisitions . cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2008 was $ 102148 and includes payments for acquisitions of $ 48109 , plus $ 1215 in contingent consideration paid on prior years 2019 acquisitions . capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 were $ 31562 compared to $ 31105 for fiscal 2008 . cash used for software development in fiscal 2009 was $ 24684 compared to $ 23736 during the prior year . net cash used in financing activities for the current fiscal year was $ 94675 and includes the repurchase of 3106 shares of our common stock for $ 58405 , the payment of dividends of $ 26903 and $ 13489 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities . cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 3773 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock ( through the employee stock purchase plan ) and $ 348 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . during fiscal 2008 , net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year was $ 101905 and includes the repurchase of 4200 shares of our common stock for $ 100996 , the payment of dividends of $ 24683 and $ 429 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities . cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 20394 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock and $ 3809 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . beginning during fiscal 2008 , us financial markets and many of the largest us financial institutions have been shaken by negative developments in the home mortgage industry and the mortgage markets , and particularly the markets for subprime mortgage-backed securities . since that time , these and other such developments have resulted in a broad , global economic downturn . while we , as is the case with most companies , have experienced the effects of this downturn , we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collection efforts , and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity will be minimized by cash generated by recurring sources of revenue and due to our access to available lines of credit. .

cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements . to be classified as upfront revenue , we require that 75% ( 75 % ) of a term or perpetual license fee be paid within the first year . conversely , payment terms for tsls are generally extended and the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually in even increments over the term of the license . accordingly , we generally receive cash from upfront license revenue much sooner than from time-based licenses revenue . fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 . cash from operating activities decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in deferred revenue due to the timing of billings and cash payments from certain customers , increased payments to vendors compared to fiscal 2008 and a tax prepayment for an irs settlement . see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements . fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 . cash from operating activities decreased primarily due to the timing of billings and cash payments from customers compared to fiscal 2007 , delivering lower cash inflows during fiscal 2008 and also as a result of a litigation settlement of $ 12.5 million received from magma during fiscal 2007 . cash used in investing activities fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 . the decrease in cash used primarily relates to a decrease in our purchases of marketable securities and cash paid for acquisitions as compared to fiscal 2008 , offset by the timing of maturities of marketable securities . fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 . the decrease in cash used primarily relates to the sale of marketable securities for our acquisition of synplicity , and as a result of lower capital expenditures during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 . cash provided by ( used in ) financing activities fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 . the increase in cash provided primarily relates to the absence of common stock repurchases in fiscal 2009 offset by a decrease in the number of options exercised by employees compared to fiscal 2008 . fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 . the increase in cash used primarily relates to more common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and options exercised by employees compared to fiscal 2007 . see note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of our stock repurchase program . we hold our cash , cash equivalents and short-term investments in the united states and in foreign accounts , primarily in ireland , bermuda , and japan . as of october 31 , 2009 , we held an aggregate of $ 612.4 million in cash , cash equivalents and short-term investments in the united states and an aggregate of $ 555.9 million in foreign accounts . funds in foreign accounts are generated from revenue outside north america . at present , such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries to the extent of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings as described in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements . we expect cash provided by operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors , including the timing of our billings and collections , our operating results , the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments and cash used in any future acquisitions . accounts receivable , net october 31 . .

l iquidity and capital resources we have historically generated positive cash flow from operations and have generally used funds generated from operations and short-term borrowings on our revolving credit facility to meet capital requirements . we expect this trend to continue in the future . the company's cash and cash equivalents decreased to $ 65565 at june 30 , 2008 from $ 88617 at june 30 , 2007 . the following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows : year ended june 30 cash provided by operations increased $ 6754 to $ 181001 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2008 as compared to $ 174247 for the fiscal year ended june 30 , 2007 . this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in expenses that do not have a corresponding cash outflow , such as depreciation and amortization , as a percentage of total net income . cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2008 was $ 102148 and includes payments for acquisitions of $ 48109 , plus $ 1215 in contingent consideration paid on prior years 2019 acquisitions . during fiscal 2007 , payments for acquisitions totaled $ 34006 , plus $ 5301 paid on earn-outs and other acquisition adjustments . capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 were $ 31105 compared to $ 34202 for fiscal 2007 . cash used for software development in fiscal 2008 was $ 23736 compared to $ 20743 during the prior year . net cash used in financing activities for the current fiscal year was $ 101905 and includes the repurchase of 4200 shares of our common stock for $ 100996 , the payment of dividends of $ 24683 and $ 429 net repayment on our revolving credit facilities . cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 20394 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock and $ 3809 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises . during fiscal 2007 , net cash used in financing activities included the repurchase of our common stock for $ 98413 and the payment of dividends of $ 21685 . as in the current year , cash used in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock of $ 29212 , $ 4640 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and $ 19388 net borrowings on revolving credit facilities . at june 30 , 2008 , the company had negative working capital of $ 11418 ; however , the largest component of current liabilities was deferred revenue of $ 212375 . the cash outlay necessary to provide the services related to these deferred revenues is significantly less than this recorded balance . therefore , we do not anticipate any liquidity problems to result from this condition . u.s . financial markets and many of the largest u.s . financial institutions have recently been shaken by negative developments in the home mortgage industry and the mortgage markets , and particularly the markets for subprime mortgage-backed securities . while we believe it is too early to predict what effect , if any , these developments may have , we have not experienced any significant issues with our current collec- tion efforts , and we believe that any future impact to our liquidity would be minimized by our access to available lines of credit . 2008 2007 2006 . .

"Single_CE/2010/page_134.pdf-2","what portion of the total shares subject to outstanding awards is under the 2009 global incentive plan?","70.1%","1.03%","<LOGIC>
Step 1: Identify the total shares subject to outstanding awards. From the table, we can see that the total shares subject to outstanding awards are 226,210,859.
Step 2: Identify the shares under the 2009 Global Incentive Plan. From the table, we can see that the shares under the 2009 Global Incentive Plan are 2,322,450.
Step 3: Calculate the portion of the total shares subject to outstanding awards that is under the 2009 Global Incentive Plan. This is done by dividing the shares under the 2009 Global Incentive Plan by the total shares subject to outstanding awards and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. 
So, the calculation is (2,322,450 / 226,210,859) * 100 = 1.03%.
